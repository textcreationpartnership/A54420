            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE miſeries which Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants uſually bring upon that unhappy people who, by impatience of a Juſt Government, and by their ſeditious attempts upon their Lawful Prince, have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the
<hi>Cheats,</hi> and are at laſt inſlaved by the <hi>Power</hi> of ſuch Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Perſons, ceaſe not with their Lives, but are extended to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age, and are apt to vex the next Generations. For although the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and Murders (which are not the greateſt unhappineſſes of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vaſſals) may poſſibly end with<pb facs="tcp:99302:6"/>the Empire of the Uſurper; yet thoſe debaucheries of the Spirits of Men, and the unquiet principles of Villany (the moſt ignominious brands of Slavery) which they introduced both to acquire and preſerve their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſurvive their Authours, and like Venome infect the blood, when the Viper is kill'd that gave the wound. Hence comes it to paſs that ſuch a People, though freed from the Force of their Oppreſſour, yet tenacious of his Crimes, debauched by impious Habits, and diſtracted with various Factions, can never conſpire to their common Peace and Safety; nor with patience ſubmit to thoſe who would reſtore them the Benefits of Society and Government. Our Age hath had too freſh an Experience of this: for the Methods of Tyranny having been acted with ſo much Induſtry, and continued with ſo great Succeſs among us, though we are now (through the benignity of Heaven) in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all ſafe Liberty that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Government, and which<pb facs="tcp:99302:6"/>can be hoped for from a Juſt and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince; yet have not men parted with thoſe Principles of Confuſion and Ruine which the Tyrants did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, but like Waves that have been toſſed with a Tempeſt, find no Calm, though the wind be down that firſt raiſed them.</p>
            <p>The method of curing ſuch a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Multitude is, to ſhew the Arts of their <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> and to diſcover that what was obtruded upon them as the Oracles of Heaven, or as the generous dictates of Free Souls, were but the accuſtomed cheats of former Tyrants, newly propoſed to an Ignorant and Credulous Generation. No diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comes with more Evidence upon Vulgar ſpirits (who cannot weigh the force of Reaſon,) then that which is made by Example: Like the <hi>Spartan</hi> Diſcipline, who to preſerve their Youth (on whom Philoſophical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes would have made but ſmall impreſſion) from Intemperance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with the Indecencies of their drunken <hi>Helots.</hi> And <hi>Menenius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99302:7"/>did retrive the <hi>Roman</hi> Populacy from their Sedition by an Apologue, which is but a fictitious Example. Such (Reader) is the deſign of publiſhing this Hiſtorical Diſcourſe, (which in the compoſing was intended but as a private Eſſay) of the Life of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; which hath ſuch a conformity with the <hi>Monſter</hi> of Our Times, that who reads the actions of the One, cannot but reflect upon the practices of the Other. So that it may ſeem to confirm the Opinion of thoſe who imagined that All humane affairs had a Circular motion, and that no Age produces any thing ſo prodigious that may not have its parallel in another. And it would give ſome credit to the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Tranſmigration: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Arts and Succeſs of Both, in riſing from an abject condition to moſt abſolute Soveraignty, and how in Both Tyranny was acted to the height of Injuſtice, one of that School would fancy that the Soul of
<hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> after ſeveral peregrinations through the forms of Tigers, Wolves, Foxes,<pb facs="tcp:99302:7"/>Harpies and Vultures, with ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions in humane ſhapes, as of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet, Borgia,</hi> and ſuch other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Mankind, it had at laſt vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world under the name of
<hi>OL. CR.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too great a diſtruſt of the Reader's Judgement to anticipate his thoughts in drawing a Parallel: the diſagreements being but few, and thoſe more properly to be referred to the diſtant Times and Scenes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they acted, (to which Both did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their deſigns) then to any difference in their temper of Spirit or variety of Luſts: Impiety, Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inhumanity being the equal delights and exerciſes of either. So that though they coaſted different Countries, yet they ſailed by the ſame Compaſs, and aimed at the ſame Port of Power and Greatneſs. In nothing more doth the Ancient ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Modern Tyrant then in his Cruelty: yet even this is not imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a more tender ſenſe of Humanity in one then the other, (<hi>For he that dares<pb facs="tcp:99302:8"/>ſometimes be wicked for his advantage, will be alwaies ſo if his Intereſt require)</hi> but to a fear of loſing the emoluments of that more powerful and proſperous cheat, the pretenſion to Sanctity; which being to be ſhadowed with a ſeeming Meekneſs, would have been too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcoloured by too frequent effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of blood. But if when we would cenſure the Crime, we conſider not onely the <hi>quantity,</hi> but the <hi>worth</hi> of the Blood, the
<hi>Sicilian</hi> will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more odious then the other. Since the Blood of a Pious, Juſt and Lawful KING, ſpilt with ſo much diſhonour to Religion and contumely to Juſtice, laies a more heavy guilt in the eyes both of God and Good men then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Plebeian gore. Beſides, that horrid
<hi>Parricide</hi> inevitably exciting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attempts for Juſtice, the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe brave Souls that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd it did accumulate the guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by their Soveraigns Blood. So that the cutting thoſe Royal veins ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch Sluces in all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that the Earth was not more<pb facs="tcp:99302:8"/>conſtantly wet with the ſhowres of Heaven, then it was yearly polluted with the blood of ſome Loyal perſon and lover of the People's Rights and Liberties. Blood of this tincture he was obſerved to drink with a guſt; though he was nauſeous of that of his own Party: whom, when their divided Intereſts made them contrive his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, or provok'd his ſpleen, he uſed as the <hi>Romans</hi> did their offending Veſtals, whoſe blood, becauſe they were conſecrated to the ſervice of their Gods, they never ſpilt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed them under ground with ſome ſmall proviſions, that ſo they might periſh without pity and unobſerved. So thoſe that had been once conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> it was unneceſſary to take away their Lives, which were hateful, becauſe they had adminiſtred to his Grandeur: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading them from his truſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to them ſome remnants of the ſpoils of Iniquity, he expoſed them to periſh in want and obſcurity.</p>
            <p>In theſe other Crimes whereby U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers<pb facs="tcp:99302:9"/>make their way to Dominion, the Wickedneſs of this Laſt was more tranſcendent, and ſuch as made our Bondage more ignominious, and our Miſeries more laſting. For not to mention thoſe frequent Perjuries, thoſe horrid Blaſphemies of referring all the moſt damnable Projects to the Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Spirit and Returns of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Religion never received a more fatal Wound then by this Modern Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. For when the Majeſty and Reverence of that ſtood like a ſtrong rampire of Juſt Authority, and like a mighty ſtream ran croſs to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; he undermined it by introducing notions agreeable to his Intereſt, made it contemptible by the baſeſt of the People whom he made Prieſts, careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every Hereſie, raiſed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed new Schiſms, and ſo cut it into ſeveral chanels and ſmall Rivulets, to make it fordable for his aſcent to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: and by proclaiming a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Liberty, reduced it into ſo many Atomes, that nothing but what was fortuitous could unite them in a ſolid<pb facs="tcp:99302:9"/>body to oppoſe him. Not content with theſe injuries to Religion, he proceeded to extirpate thoſe eternal rules of Right and Wrong, which even Nature had impreſſed upon the Minds of Men. For by his Inſtruments new Schemes of Juſtice were compoſed, new rules of Obedience and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were framed according to the Inſtitutes of Tyranny. The ſacred Religion of an Oath, the foundation of Society even in the moſt barbarous Nations, was among us publiſhed no longer obliging then till an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enſued. Thus as <hi>Caligula</hi> took off the heads of thoſe Images of the Gods that were moſt worſhipped, and ſet his own upon them, that he might receive the adorations of the people: ſo did this Uſurper pervert thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Life, the Laws of God and Nature, that we might receive onely the Dictates of his Luſt and Intereſt, and be guided by the deceitful Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his deluding Spirit.</p>
            <p>How far he prevailed by theſe Arts in vitiating the ſenſe of Religion and<pb facs="tcp:99302:10"/>Juſtice in men, appeared too evident in the ſervile Flattery of thoſe <hi>Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> which were made to his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Succeſſour. In which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers by a prodigious Sacriledge ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rifled all the Sacred Records, and thence took thoſe attributes of Glory with which as Jewels God had ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his choiceſt Servants, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them as Odours to embalm their Memories to Poſterity, applied them to his ſucceſsful Wickedneſs. So that they ſeemed to have forgotten what Vertue and Righteouſneſs were, when they crowned Impiety with the rewards of Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>And how pregnant the Principles he had acted by were of Deſtruction, by the juſt Judgement of Heaven was experienced on his Infamous Iſſue, they being ruined by the ſame practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by which himſelf had deſtroied the lawful Government; the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Example deſtroying thoſe of his Blood; the miniſters of the Father's Villanies being the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Son's Empire. Nor was<pb facs="tcp:99302:10"/>the miſchievouſneſs of his Arts confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within his own Family, but like an infectious Contagion ſpread it ſelf over the whole Nation. His Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exciting every bold hand and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit to invade the Government: and his Principles ſerving to colour the proſperous Invader's Perfidiouſneſs to his ſupplanted and complaining Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours. That Power would they to day deſpoil and vilifie, with whom it was on their Hearts the day before to Live and Die. What they bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led yeſterday as their Backſliding, to day they would practiſe as their Saint-like Obedience to the Call of God. So that by reaſon of theſe different Actings, ſometime as Men, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Saints, like creatures of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous elements, there was no faith among themſelves, nor conſtancy in their Wickedneſs; but varying their Crimes, and together with their Guilt increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Miſeries, the Sun ſeldome roſe but he ſaw the ruines of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had left at his ſetting, and the erection of a new. And Peace<pb facs="tcp:99302:11"/>and Quietneſs were ſet at ſuch a diſtance from our hopes, that they could not be expected but after a Deſolation.</p>
            <p>Then which effects though nothing could be more convincing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiveneſs of ſuch Principles and Practices, that they neither proceeded from God, who is the Authour of Order and Government, nor agreed with Juſtice, which is the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Peace: yet becauſe they ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently pretended to an Extract from Heaven, and ſeemed to be owned by it in an uninterrupted Succeſs againſt a Lawful Soveraign, and are ſtill impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately urged by Perſons of no juſt hopes, and whoſe broken Intereſts are impatient of a calm; they are as yet received by ſome deluded Souls as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and as the ſober dictates of right Reaſon; and the miſchievous Conſequences are reputed the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Actors, not the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Iſſues of the Principles. But as the Divine Records do vindicate the Immaculate Purity of God (from whom nothing proceeds which doth not make<pb facs="tcp:99302:11"/>men happy in obedience to it) from having any benigne influence on ſuch deſtructive counſels, and right Reaſon doth free Juſtice from any alliance with ſuch wicked practices: ſo the Hiſtory of all Ages will teſtifie that theſe have been the artifices of Ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſeeking a criminal Greatneſs, have deveſted themſelves of all ſenſe of Vertue, do by theſe waies delude and diſtract the minds of men, that ſo being weakned by their own Factions, and diſarmed by vitious habits, they may more eaſily be oppreſſed by them. And this Hiſtory of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity by <hi>Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> (from whom it was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered) will evidently ſhew, That <hi>the uſual Method of overthrowing an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government eſtabliſhed by Law, is to ſlander the actions and counſels of the preſent Magiſtrate;</hi> That <hi>thoſe that have the extremeſt Tyranny in projection, will be the greateſt pretenders of the Publick good, and the moſt importunate aſſertors of the People's Rights;</hi> That <hi>it is the moſt compendious way of impoſing Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,<pb facs="tcp:99302:12"/>by raiſing in the Multitude too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and paſsionate deſires of Liberty;</hi> That
<hi>in a corrupted and diſquiet State, the moſt Contemptible member of that Community may without the help of a Miracle ariſe to Soveraignty;</hi> That
<hi>it is not the Indulgence of Heaven to the Uſurper, but the Indignation thereof to the People, when Succeſs attends the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants enterprizes;</hi> That <hi>Power acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Fraud or Violence will never be emploied in the exerciſe of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe therefore being the onely fruits that are to be expected from the unquiet Principles and deluding hopes which deſigning Demagogues infect the People with; Wiſe men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adviſed that even the Vices of Bad Princes are to be born with the like Patience as we endure Dearths and Tempeſts, and other deviations of Nature from her uſual courſe. And this not to flatter Offending Kings, (who at a moſt dreadful Tribunal are accountable for their diſobediences to their Eternal Superiour) but in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to mankind, and pity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable<pb facs="tcp:99302:12"/>Multititude. Becauſe though Princes, as they are Men, may be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, yet as ſuch are not Immortal; and a Pious Succeſſour may repair all the ruines of a former Oppreſſour. But when the People will uſurp the Office of Heaven, whoſe Prerogative it is to chaſtiſe Kings, and to cut off the Fury of Princes, and they themſelves will correct their lawful Magiſtrates, God moſt ſeverely puniſhes them by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the baſeſt of men to ride over their heads. And the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thought it not onely their
<hi>Duty,</hi> but their <hi>Prudence,</hi> by praiers and tears onely to ſeek the deliverance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the injuries of a Governour, rather then by oppoſing, their lawful Soveraign to adminiſter to a Tyrants Ambition, who, according to that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, <hi>of changing all things that were under the former Governour,</hi> muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face Religion to maintain his Power, and on the diſhonour of Piety build his Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>We have had experience of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Heaven for our Sins, in giving<pb facs="tcp:99302:13"/>us over to the deluſions of men, who ſought and acquired Power by ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a <hi>PRINCE</hi> whoſe moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Worth we underſtood not, till our ignorance had made Him and us miſerable. Which Power being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly got, was not otherwiſe uſed: For the Treaſures and Ornaments of many Ages Peace were waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by their Oppreſſions in a few years. And we are now under the return of Mercy by a Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. Both Conditions may teach us to meaſure the Benefits and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of Government as they are in their own nature: and not by the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter interpretations and ſeditious Harangues of Unquiet perſons, who will calumniate even the juſteſt Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and the wiſeſt Counſels. And if the diſcovery of the methods of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which is made in this Hiſtory, may contribute any thing to effect a juſt hatred of ſuch practices, or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſober Minds in a thankful acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in that Gracious Providence which hath reſtored our ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb facs="tcp:99302:13"/>and given us a Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed both by Affliction and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the beſt arts of Empire; the Compiler hath attained his chiefeſt ends.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſecurity and comforts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life conſiſt in
<hi>Society. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> cannot be preſerved without <hi>Order.</hi> For although by it men are ſecured from a forein force, yet in it are they ſubject to inteſtine injuries; and when Neceſſity makes no warre abroad, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Covetouſneſs will raiſe ſome at home. (Theſe being ſo impetuous and reſtleſs<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99302:20"/>affections in the breaſts of men, that they never leave them, even after the largeſt acquiſitions.) For man naturally is greedy of every thing, yet ſo weak that he can acquire but few: ſo that the deſire being too great for the power of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, there ariſes a diſſatisfaction with the preſent condition, when it is ſecure, and an endeavour of altering it, though with the ruine of another's fortune. This immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in ſome men of more then they have, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a fear in others of loſing what they doe enjoy; and from both theſe ariſe Jealouſies, Enmities and Injuries, which in the iſſue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine Societie, and render it more dangerous then Solitude, and make Communities of men more obnoxious to ruine then heards of Beaſts. Therefore <hi>Order</hi> muſt ſet bounds to ſome mens Luſts, and fences for the ſecurity of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Order</hi> cannot be obſerved without
<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is the Intruſting ſome perſons with the care and power of maintaining this <hi>Order.</hi> And that it may the more effectually attain its End, Heaven hath declared it as its own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and impreſſed upon it the luſtre of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority. But as Pearls, though they have their Original from the dew of Heaven, yet muſt be formed and ſolidated in the Sea and the wombe of a Shel fiſh, which as it is more or leſs diſpoſed by Nature for ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99302:20"/>renders the Jewels proportionably great and orient: So
<hi>Government,</hi> though it derives its extract from a Divine Inſtitution, yet becauſe it is to be managed by Men which are ſubject to Corruption, doth often prove too uncertain a guard for ſo great a treaſure as is the publick good and common ſafety. Becauſe the Truſtees of this power may either through the depravedneſs of their affections diſtort it to the ſatisfaction of their private luſts; or by an imprudent menage, give umbrages of ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they will pervert it to the common ruine. So that ſuch impotent perſons being in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bewitched with the ſweetneſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and paſſionate to inlarge or preſerve that power in the unlawful exerciſe thereof, make frequent invaſions upon the Liberty of others. And thoſe that are under Government, pinched with the difficulties of obeying ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Commands, and labouring to keep their liberty entire, ſtrive to extend it even to Licence, till it becomes inconſiſtent with Government. Hence ariſe Diſcontents, Jealouſies, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Government, which to ſick minds, like the turnings in bed to ſick bodies, are hoped for remedies: and what men cannot find un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind of <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> they will ſeek in another; and therefore do either contract or enlarge the ſubject of their truſt of Power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of their preſent Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all worldly things are in a continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there is either a progreſs to perfection in that which is good, or elſe a precipitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to evil, and <hi>men are moſt eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the ſupremeſt Fortunes, where Luſts may have the advantage of being armed with Power:</hi> ſuch as received the higheſt Command as a reward of Vertue either in themſelves or Anceſtors, do ſometimes abuſe it to licenſe the moſt horrid Crimes; imagining Rapines, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Capricioes of Power the rewards of Principality, wherein they onely receive but a fading Pleaſure, and leave to their Subjects a perpetual ſenſe of Loſs and Diſhonour. Hence comes it to paſs, that thoſe who by Vertuous Practices might have maintained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Earthly Gods, by theſe wicked Courſes degenerating beneath the nature of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99302:21"/>Beaſts, become hateful and terrible to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
               <p>Hate and Fear are alwaies pregnant with Conſpiracies. Conſpiracies that prove ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (for otherwiſe they advantage him whom they deſign to ruine) are ſooneſt formed and moſt dexterouſly managed, not by ſuch as are fearful and weak, but by perſons of generous ſpirits and active Souls, who are moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of injuries, and moſt impatient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. Theſe being exalted above the reſt of the injured Multitude by the greatneſs of their Minds, and made more powerful to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the deſign by the riches of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the liberality of their Education, and the Nobility of their Families, become the Chiefs of the Community for Security, and Revenge on their unjuſt <hi>Monarch.</hi> He being extinguiſhed, the People tranſlate the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which before they were wont to pay to a ſingle Prince, on theſe perſons whom they look upon as their Deliverers.</p>
               <p>Theſe having the Government of a ſingle Perſon, and fearing the return of the ſame Miſeries from another <hi>Monarch,</hi> or elſe pleaſed with the preſent Adorations of the Multitude, do retain the Government among themſelves, which ſeated in ſuch and ſo many perſons is called <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi> Theſe in their beginnings bound their power with ſuch Laws, as (being<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99302:22"/>made in the freſh memorie of the former Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie) appear very tender of the Common liberty, and preferre the Publick to the Private Intereſt. Which adminiſtration of Juſtice, partly through the Novelty, (which alwaies hath much of the People's hopes,) and partly through the Cares of the New Governours (which are commonly moſt ſtrict in their firſt undertakings) to manage all concernments with the moſt exact moderation, is entertained ſome time with honour and conformable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But <hi>men ſeldome uſe Dignities with the ſame good arts whereby they acquired them, and aſſume another heart in the Palace then what they wore in their private families.</hi> So that corruption either aſſaults their very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or in a ſhort time ſeizeth upon their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; who unacquainted with the Inſtability of Fortune, and inſenſible of the diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of publick Injuries, grow inſolent with their preſent ſtate, diſcontent with equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and forming Factions among themſelves, reduce all power into a few hands, and change the <hi>Optimacie</hi> into an <hi>Oligarchie.</hi> Thence falling into the debaucheries of the former Tyrant, and their Number making them leſs tolerable, they incur the ſame hatred, and meet with the like ruine. For the People haraffed by ſo many importunate Oppreſſors, will ſoon offer its miniſtery to any bold hand that will offend their deteſted Governours. Neither will<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99302:22"/>there want unquiet Spirits, that will take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the People's anger and aſſiſtance, both to ruine them, and raiſe themſelves in the Popular eſteem.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Oligarchie</hi> hath loſt that power which they knew not how to uſe, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are free to another choice, the memory of injuries by a Prince being not yet dead, and the brands of ſlavery by more numerous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants yet freſh, the People are unwilling any more to truſt after ſo many abuſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſerve the Government in themſelves, which then receives the name of <hi>Democracie.</hi> This form of Government after it hath ſpent that ſtock of Vulgar affection which is uſed to be given to every thing in its firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, diſcovers that they have embraced Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence inſtead of Liberty; and whereas all
<hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> ſhould be the preſervative of <hi>Order,</hi> this fills all with <hi>Confuſion.</hi> The body of the Society is torn into ſeveral Factions, and of one Community it becomes many. The Laws are neither framed nor executed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Utility, but for the advantage of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parties, each by its courſe in Magiſtracie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to depreſs the contrary, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it ſelf. In this State, as in routed Armies, every one commands, and none obeyes; the moſt prudent muſt be directed by thoſe that have no skil to command, and the wiſeſt follow
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99302:23"/>the dictates of the ignorant rabble; thoſe that are fitteſt to give the ſafeſt counſels, muſt by a ſimple obedience be the inſtruments to perform the decrees of ruine. Heroick Vertues and brave Examples are as dangerous here as under the worſt of Tyrants, and both the Love and the Hate of the People are equally dangerous. So that this Government laſts no longer then till the univerſal calamities (which come ſpeedily) diſſolve it; or ſome ambitious Officer takes from the Multitude that Liberty which they could not long keep; or ſome diſcreeter Citizen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to ſeek for peace and ſafety in the paths they have forſaken, and to return to Principality again.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the uſual ſtages which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment treads; and as the Perſons are qualified in each ſtate, it makes the ſhorter or longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. But in every change, as the Sun in his removal to the ſeveral Tropicks, leaves the laſt ſquallid and deformed with cold and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo <hi>Government leaves the laſt intruſted with it in ruine and deſolation.</hi> And the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the motion is, the more pregnant it is with deſtruction. For Ambulatorie Government is like the Planets which, obſervation tells us, both at their riſing and ſetting bring Storms and Tempeſts: ſo the ruine of the old, and the erection of a new form, waſt and tire thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people that live under them. Bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99302:23"/>being like Malignant ſpirits, which when they are exorciſed torture more eagerly the wretches they are to forſake; and theſe are induſtrious to ruine all with their fall, and that an univerſal flame might be kindled by their Funeral Pile. On the other ſide, new and hopeful frames of Government, though they are as deſirable as Children to leſs-fruitful wombs, yet, like ſuch, come not into the world without pangs and throes, and ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their lives with the death of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>But in nothing are changes and corruptions of Government more noxious to a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then in that they are often inlets and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to
<hi>Uſurpation,</hi> adminiſtring opportunities to ambitious ſpirits of uſurping Magiſtracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Peoples conſent, and contrary to the juſt pretenſions which other Perſons may have to the ſame. For from all theſe ſeveral forms of Government declining to a diſſolution, do Tyrannical <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> like Prodigies that are generated of Corruption, ariſe. And when ſuch do prevail and attain to power, that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people that are ſubject to it muſt expect the worſt of miſeries which are derived from Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Injuſtice. For Uſurpers being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of ſuch, are, as every thing is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by its Principles, to be maintained by the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99302:24"/>To an <hi>Uſurper</hi> no Qualities are more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite then to contemn God, vilify Mankind, and hate all Religion and Juſtice. He muſt know and dare to be exactly wicked, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any good beyond the appearance. He muſt pretend an affection to Religion, but it muſt be onely that he may deflower it; not by it to contract a friendſhip and league with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that he may more eaſily cheat, and execute his malice upon men. Faithfulneſs and Truth muſt be eſteemed by him as the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rocks on which his Power would ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; therefore his Oathes and Promiſes are like thoſe monſtrous Chymaera's, whoſe upper and more viſible parts have an humane and beautiful aſpect, but in their extremities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt noxious Prodigies. He permits the pleaſures and lovely names of Mercy and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſoft ſouls and juſt Princes; but neither time, ſupplications, or ſatiety, which uſe to ſoften others, can mitigate a Tyrants fury, which is raiſed by his own jealouſies: for he muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Suſpicions as manifeſt Crimes, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent the Innocency of others to cover his own Guilt. He muſt injure all he fears, and hate all he hath injured.</p>
               <p>To thoſe unhappy people whom he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved, he muſt endeavour to leave no more then the names and ſhapes of men, and that their humane bodies be but falſe harbours for<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99302:24"/>brutiſh Souls. If it be poſſible, he muſt raſe out thoſe principles of <hi>Liberty, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which Nature hath impreſſed on the Spirits of men. For to be Vertuous under a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is to undermine his Empire, becauſe good Examples upbraid his Weakneſs, and rebel againſt the Cuſtomes of his Luſts, which he would have as a Law. And Reaſon hath more light in it then will ſuffer a Tyrants arts to be undiſcovered; therefore he will murder all thoſe whom he cannot corrupt, leſt they ſhould be guides and lights for the recovery of Freedome; and ſecure himſelf in the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by introducing a barbarous Ignorance, which ſhall obſtruct the waies to Prudence: and by vexing Vertue with ignominy and danger, (as the
<hi>Romans</hi> puniſh'd criminal Virgins, firſt deflouring them by the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and afterwards ſtrangling them) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpates the love of it out of the breaſts of men. He interprets Friendſhip and Love among his vaſſals as a dangerous Combination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breaks all the ligaments of a Community which Religion or Nature have formed in it, that he may twiſt the cords of Bondage ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the moſt binding cement of humane affections, he renders weak by its variety: and when the People cannot agree about their <hi>Gods,</hi> they ſeldome conſpire to any publick benefit, or againſt a Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as a Tyrant is. Or elſe he embaſes it with<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99302:25"/>the alloy of wicked and abject Principles. Men being ſeldome more generous then the Deities they worſhip, and their ſpirits are but level to their Devotions. <hi>From the Courts of Uſurping Tyrants crept thoſe monſtrous Idolatries of Calves, Dogs, Cats and Crocodiles.</hi> Their civil and natural unions muſt be broken alſo. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conventions, where converſe creates a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, and that a mutual confidence, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo publick Feaſts, which are the ſinews of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, are either wholly forbidden, or made dangerous by his Spyes, who are to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the looſe ſpeeches of men made free by wine and exceſs, and form the ſimplicity of Table-talk into compacts of Treaſon; ſo that by ſuch treacheries an univerſal diffidence is created, and members of the ſame City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſtrange to each other, as if they dwelt under the oppoſite Poles. Nor can a Tyrant be ſafe, unleſs he diſſolve the private as well as the publick unions. Therefore Wives are bribed with their own diſhonour, a licence for a wandering Luſt and aſſurance of Alimonie, to betray their Husbands. Sons by too early hopes of Patrimony are ſollicited to rifle their Fathers cabinets, unlock their ſecrets, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the Tyrants bloudie fury. And Servants have a liberty beyond manumiſſion to make their Maſters bondmen. For while every houſe flames with contention, the Uſurper may, like <hi>Nero,</hi> ſecurely ſing and play. Their<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99302:25"/>Fortunes muſt be no better then their Souls; for he muſt make them poor and needy, that all their cares being employed for neceſſary ſubſiſtence, they may have no leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive their Liberty. While his <hi>Gabels</hi> waſte their goods, he muſt make Warres to conſume their multitude, leſt the contemplation of their Number produce a confidence in their ſtrength, to break that power which doth oppreſs them. For <hi>Tyrants meaſure not their power by their own force, but by the weakneſs of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vaſſals.</hi> His Inſtruments of ſlavery muſt be ſuch that either have no Reaſon to diſpute, or no Conſcience to ſcruple the moſt impious Commands, whoſe Fortunes are made by his ſpoiles of villany, and whoſe ſafety onely depends upon his ſervice. Yet when they have performed his work, he uſes them as the
<hi>Roman Aediles</hi> did beaſts and malefactors in the Theatres, when they would recreate the People in their <hi>Spectacula,</hi> make them accuſe and deſtroy one the other: ſo they fall with the publick applauſe whom before he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the publick hate. For their obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to his luſts cannot ſecure them from his fury. Becauſe <hi>inſtruments of great crimes do even with their ſight upbraid him that emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</hi> Or elſe he fearing that what they have done for him, they may practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, therefore he will ſerve them as thoſe that killed the Poſt-horſes by which<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99302:26"/>they fled, leſt others ſhould uſe them in their purſuit.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Inſtitutes of Tyrannie, which the practices and dictates of former <hi>Uſurpers</hi> have tranſmitted as Oracles religiouſly to be obſerved by ſuch whoſe blinded Souls prefer Power to Vertue, and an ignominious Greatneſs to the Innocency of a Private life. And under ſuch a Magiſtrate that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe as the Reiglements of Empire and Myſteries of State, what can the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but the greateſt miſeries a Societie can be ſubject to? To which kind of puniſhment incenſed Heaven moſt commonly condemns an unquiet people, who corrupted with Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and grown wanton by a long Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impatient of Laws, and diſcontent with lawful Governours; that when they know not how moderately to uſe a juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they might be made ſenſible of the heavieſt Slavery. <hi>Uſurpers proving to be the moſt inſupportable Tyrants.</hi> For although a lawful Prince may poſſibly degenerate into Tyranny; yet hath he no neceſſity nor incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to it: becauſe when his own Vertues, or the happy memory of his Anceſtors, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the People's Love, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon his Dignity with their Conſent, he cannot imagine (unleſs infatuated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) any ſurer <hi>baſis</hi> for his Power then<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99302:26"/>what He firſt ſtood upon, the Affections of his Subjects, and the Juſtice of his Title. But an Uſurper that either by force or deceit hath impoſed upon them, doth in his very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance create cauſes of Hatred in the People, and of Fears in himſelf: thence flow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſires of Revenge and Security in each other, which are not to be ſatisfied but by mutual Injuries. And he that wreſtles with the People's hate, will find himſelf as born under the Starre of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> who when he had cut off one of the <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads, had his labours renewed by the ſudden production of many more: and while a Tyrant ſeeks to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf by injuring one of his ſuſpected Enemies, he will provoke a multitude more eager for his ruine. So that he ſhall find himſelf neceſſitated, if he will keep what he hath wickedly got, to repeat his Crimes, and increaſe their miſeries, till they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Liberty, ſtupid under their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and neither deſirous nor able to take revenge.</p>
               <p>Of the barbarous effects of this kind of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie no place was evermore ſenſible then the Iſland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> a Country continually teeming with theſe Monſters, who endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to enſlave their Cities, and perpetuate their Dominion, made that Iſland the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre

And among all thoſe plagues of mankind and diſturbers of Society, whoſe acts Antiquity hath tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to poſterity, none have their memories branded with more eternal marks of Infamy then <hi>Agathocles,</hi> whoſe bloody Artifices and execrable practices to raiſe himſelf from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and baſe condition to an abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and from being the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of a Community to arrive at ſuch a power as to trample upon the Liberties of his City, made the Ancient Hiſtorians never mention him without the Title of
<hi>The moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</hi> And <hi>Machiavel,</hi> the modern Criuck of Policy and grand Inſtructor of Tyranny, ſingles him out of the whole Herd of antique Monſters as the ſingular Patern of Tyranny, and Example of ſuch that by Injuſtice and Impiety will acquire Principality: in whoſe aſcent to Greatneſs he acknowledgeth no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Vertue, nor any favourable aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from Fortune; but that all his Power was the ſole product of a monſtrous Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which will appear in this Hiſtory of his Life.</p>

               <p>This is the relation of <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world; a Birth proper for a Tyrant, wherein he proved terrible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99302:28"/>to thoſe that were the Authors of his life. But ſuch Prodigies and Predictions as theſe are of a dubious credit and uncertain Original. For although the Longanimity of Heaven, that unwillingly puniſhes the ſins of men, may and doth ſometimes, by means that ſeem moſt proper to its infinite Wiſdome, before it ſtrikes, warn the World of thoſe plagues that ſhall come upon them: yet moſt of theſe Oracles which we meet with in Hiſtory are poſt-nate, and after the fact invented and publiſhed; and that from various beginnings. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the Vulgar, who are more Superſtitious then Religious, will either find or frame a Prediction for every great Event:</hi> Becauſe they being ignorant of the true Cauſes of things, and not able to obſerve the progreſs of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but conſidering the Event in its full product, cannot but admire it, and therefore attribute it to that power which onely can work wonders; and ſo ſeek or make a Decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſhould convey the Iſſues through ſo many ſeeming difficulties. Hence alſo it came to paſs that when men of obſcure births have performed great actions in the World, their deſcent not fully appearing, when their actions were full of ſplendour, they have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined their Vertue was to be their Herald, and ſo did derive their pedegree from the Gods; as <hi>Hercules</hi> from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and
<hi>Romulus</hi> from <hi>Mars.</hi> And becauſe the Divine Providence,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99302:29"/>willing to ſhew that its ſole power, and not the prudence of Men, doth make them great, doth often expoſe ſuch in their Infancy to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whom in their riper years it intends to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to mighty Honours; thereby beginning to demonſtrate its force, when Prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to their preſervation: the Vulgar likewiſe fits by their fancies, for thoſe whom with admiration they behold raiſed from low beginnings to unexpected Greatneſs, ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments in the World as muſt require the care of the Gods for their preſervation. Thus the
<hi>Romans</hi> formed the beginnings of their <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the

<hi>Spain</hi> for their King <hi>Habis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are the rude Multitude the onely authors of ſuch fabulous Miracles, but Tyrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which accommodate their deſigns to the Vulgar fancies, are frequently the very Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that frame Predictions concerning their own grandeur. For theſe either deſigning the change of their Republicks, or being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeized of power, do labour to make the world believe that Heaven is of the Plot, and concerned in their preſervation: nothing being more prevalent upon the minds of men then Religion, which Tyrants by theſe Oracles make uſe of, to produce an awe in their oppreſſed Vaſſals, that they ſhould not vainly attempt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99302:29"/>to break thoſe chains which Fate hath impoſed on them, and by their efforts upon their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, ſeem to undertake a fruitleſs warre, to reverſe the Decrees of Providence. Thus
<hi>Lyſander</hi> projecting the change of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of
<hi>Sparta,</hi> would engage the Gods in the deſign, and corrupted the Prieſts to forge Oracles for the ſame. <hi>Agrippina</hi>'s ambition to have her Son reign, prompted her to diſperſe a Miracle to make way for it, that the Gods to preſerve him for the Empire, had appointed two Serpents to be the Guardians of his Infancy. <hi>Catiline,</hi> to inflame
<hi>Lentulus</hi> to burn <hi>Rome,</hi> fed his ambitious and empty Soul with ſome dark Oracle out of the <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s leaves. And ſuch who have graſped at great deſigns, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make the world believe that there was alwaies ſome commerce betwixt the Gods and them. <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> would never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any action, before he had ſome time ſate in the Capitol in the Shrine of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> from whom he would be conceived to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with ſome Heroick airs: ſo that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with confidence followed that Leader whom they believed the Gods directed.
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Slave in <hi>Sicily,</hi> pretending inſpirations from the
<hi>Syrian</hi> Goddeſs, ſoon gathered up an Army of ſixty thouſand men, who, as if they ſeemed to follow the commands of the Gods, ſtoutly aſſiſted this their imaginary King, and overthrew four <hi>Roman</hi> Praetors with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99302:30"/>
                  <hi>Sandrocot,</hi> a Greek Fugitive, having by Art reduced a Lion from his natural fierceneſs, to come and lick the ſweat of his body, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Indians</hi> that the Gods had deſigned him for Empire by ſubjecting the Beaſt to his ſervice; and he was readily accepted by them for their Prince, and emploied to recover their Liberty from the Captains of <hi>Alexander:</hi> who freeing them from that yoke, did oppreſs them with his own Tyranny. So eaſily do the multitude follow that choice which they believe Heaven hath made; admiring him whom they fancy the Gods have loved, and fearing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe who pretend a Deity to be their Guardian. Which natural reverence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Religious ſimplicity in the minds of men, the Tyrants make their firſt advantage to aſcend to power. And it is poſſible that
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> was no leſs impudent to deceive the people and abuſe the Gods this way then he was in his other practices, and had compoſed this Miracle when he firſt imagined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Tyranny; founding his firſt hopes of Dominion in a Superſtitious fear of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous multitude.</p>
               <p>The Fate of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having thus preſerved him that was to be their Scourge, he was brought up by his Uncle <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclidas,</hi> and grew to be of a comely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and luſty frame of body beyond<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99302:30"/>his years. When he came to ſeven years of age, his Father <hi>Carcinus</hi> was invited by
<hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clidas</hi> to a Sacrifice: where ſeeing <hi>Agathocles</hi> playing together with ſome of his mates, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through ſome ſecret motion of Nature, or by the rarity and pleaſantneſs of the ſight, he was much affected with the beauty and vigour of the Boy. His Wife obſerving it, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſuggeſt unto him, that juſt ſuch an one their Son would have been had he not been ſo inhumanely expoſed. <hi>Carcinus</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he was ſorry his fears had tranſported him beyond natural affection, and to ſhew his reſentment, exceedingly wept. His Wife conceiving his preſent affections to comport with her deſign, acquaints him with the whole ſtory, how ſhe had ſaved the Child, and that this was the ſame. He was extremely pleaſed with the relation, and with joy received his Son, whom Providence and the affection of a Mother had ſo preſerved: but doubting leſt the receiving of his Son to his own houſe ſhould quicken the remembrance of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſo expoſe them both to the
<hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Fury, he removed his narrow Family out of their Dominions, and planted himſelf at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> the ſtage on which his Son was to act thoſe various Scenes of Blood and Villany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carcinus</hi> at his new habitation was ſo poor and deſtitute of friends, that to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99302:31"/>and his Family, he emploi'd himſelf in making of Pots, and taught his ſon the ſame trade, that he might contribute ſomething to his maintenance. Which occupation, being the Embleme of abſolute Dominion, did ſeem to habituate his haughty and aſpiring Soul to the practice of a boundleſs Power; and by compoſing clay to the forms of his own fancy, he did inure himſelf to module Societies and Commonwealths to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of his own Luſts and intereſt. In this mean trade <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> and his ſon did onely wreſtle with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and poverty, and could never increaſe his ſubſtance to the Cenſe of a Citizen; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a long time lived as a burden, not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of that Community: till ſuch time as
<hi>Timoleon,</hi> the Scourge of Tyrants, having freed <hi>Sicily</hi> from thoſe Monſters, to repleniſh <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> which the cruelty and horrid at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of thoſe Uſurpers had almoſt depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, did grant the priviledges and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the City to all that would come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite there: at which time <hi>Agathocles</hi> with his Father were inrolled among the Citizens, and did enjoy that Liberty which he was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carcinus</hi> not long after dies, and leaves the care of this young Potter to his ſurviving Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: who in a feminine fondneſs of her Son, would needs ſet up his Effigies made in ſtone<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99302:31"/>in one of the Temples of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> On which a ſwarm of Bees did one day ſettle, and made their little Cells of wax betwixt the thighs of it. The <hi>Augurs,</hi> and ſuch as addicted themſelves to the vain curioſity of the future, being conſulted concerning this accident, gave this anſwer;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>That when her ſon came to years of maturity, he ſhould arrive to great dignity.</hi>
                  </q> A conjecture which, becauſe it was anſwered in the Event, became an obſervation, and was tranſmitted to poſterity. Whereas <hi>the greateſt part of</hi> ſuch
<hi>vain Auguries are buried in oblivion, when the ſucceſs makes them not authentick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe low beginnings did <hi>Agathocles</hi> ariſe to a Principality. Thus the Providence of Heaven ſometimes, to mock the pride of Princes, and baffle the Inſolencies of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as alſo to aſſert its own abſolute over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Power, doth permit the inhabitants of the dunghill to poſſeſs the Palaces of Kings, and gives the Kingdomes of the world to the baſeſt of men. He that ſhall obſerve and conſider the Examples that are in ancient and modern Hiſtory, will find how much of Mockery there is in all humane affairs, and how ſhort-ſighted that which we call Humane Providence is to foreſee and prevent future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; for when jealous Cities have provided for their Liberty by the baniſhment of their moſt potent Citizens, and the Oſtraciſme of ſuch<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99302:32"/>who by their noble extracts and deſcent from imperial Originals are moſt to be ſuſpected to impoſe upon the rights of their Country, they have been many times inſlaved by ſome contemptible member of their Community. And frequently in Kingdomes, not thoſe whom Fame or Hope deſtined to Empire, but whom Providence hath in ſecret reſerved to be the future Prince, have aſcended the Throne. And the higheſt Commands, which men conceive the due reward of all Vertues, and the portion of the beſt-deſcended, are yet ſometimes given to the vileſt perſons, and the Majeſty of Empire profaned by moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject exerciſers of that power, as Slaves, Thieves, Fencers and Shepherds, or ſuch like dregs of the people. This happens not but through the juſt Indignation of Heaven againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and ſinful people, when not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear the moderate Rule of lawful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are condemned to ſerve ſuch reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lords. The <hi>Romans</hi> bewailed the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Fortune when they were forced, in preſerving their Dignity and defending their Aſſociates, to ſend forth juſt Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch theatrical Princes, as if they had been honourable and lawful Kings; and as it were aſhamed of their Victory, they thought the majeſty of a Triumph would be polluted if it were granted to the ſubduers of ſuch ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Commanders. The ignominy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99302:32"/>of the Tyrant muſt needs aggravate the bondage of thoſe that are compelled to ſerve him. And by how much they are removed from the juſt hopes of the ſupreme power, they are ſo much the more immoderate in their pride and ambition when they arrive unto it; their Souls being, like half-famiſhed ſtomachs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable with Dominion. In the exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are like Comets, which being but Exhalations of the earth, when they are raiſed to the height, and kindled to the brightneſs of a Star, do portend ruine to the greateſt perſons and the beſt families. So ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible men elevated to power do rage moſt againſt the better and moſt vertuous parts of a Society, and ſeek to hide the baſeneſs of their own, by ſpilling all the nobler blood. And as ſubterranean fires which firſt feed upon the roots, and then conſume the entrails of great mountains, do from thence ſpread aſhes and ruine upon the adjacent Valleys and neighbouring plains; ſo do ſuch men, fired with ambition, labour to undermine the Optimacy, which are the ſupereminent parts of every Community, and then diffuſe vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and miſery upon the Populacy. And ſuch did
<hi>Agathocles</hi> prove to be to the miſerable <hi>Syracuſans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s Birth and Childhood, though poor and obſcure, were yet more polluted by<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99302:33"/>his vitious Youth and his following conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For he was more infamous by the courſe of his life, then for the meanneſs of his birth; becauſe <hi>not the beginnings, but the progreſs of our lives are the ſubjects of our choice, and it is that which renders us capable of ſhame or glory.</hi> And as Vertue is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon Patrician families; ſo by no Decree of Fate or law of Nature is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from Plebeian breaſts: but ſuch as can boaſt no glory of their Anceſtors, may yet be admired for their own Heroick actions. And many of thoſe great actions which the world hath wondred at, have been performed by perſons who were obſcure in their Originall, and had no advantage for Fame from their birth. <hi>Vertue whereſoever it is placed, draws the reverence and affection of men;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Gallant perſons as they do fair and great Trees, in which are commended the ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, height and bigneſs of the Trunk, and the large extent and beauty of the Branches; but ſeldome is it inquired of the meaſure and depth of their Roots. <hi>Rome</hi> never repented the prodigality of her Honours in ſix Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips to <hi>Marius</hi> a Plebeian, while ſhe received no leſs glory and ſafety from his conduct then from any of her Patrician Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls; and while he was contented to receive, not force the people's favour, which
<hi>is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moſt prone and indulgent to new appearers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99302:33"/>in the State.</hi> But when his Ambition made him impatient of reſt, and he would raviſh, not court, his City's love, and ſnatch thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which ſhe had deſigned to others, he appeared in his ſeventh Conſulſhip no leſs dangerous to his own Citizens in peace, then he was to their Enemies in war. So that not his Birth, but his Vices diſgraced his former dignities, and expoſed him to the publick hatred.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Agathocles</hi> his Youth was more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful then his Trade, and continued the ignominy of his Infancy with the diſhonour of his riper years: for being of a comely frame and lovely viſage, he did allure, and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute himſelf as a common <hi>Bardacio</hi> to every man's Luſt who was able to pay the reward of his infamy. And that he might not be unacquainted with any iniquity, he afterwards transferred his Luſt from men to women; that as before he injured the Wives by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the affections of their Husbands, ſo he would abuſe the Husbands with the Diſhonour of their Wives. And in theſe practices he ſpent his firſt years, living ſo contemptibly, that he was without any eſteem or regard, as one that had no Fortune to be ſollicitous to preſerve, nor any Credit or Modeſty to be tender of.</p>
               <p>But by theſe baſer Arts he at length got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99302:34"/>favour with <hi>Damas</hi> one of the wealthieſt
<hi>Syracuſans,</hi> by becoming his Pathick, and into the affections of his Wife, by being her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. This man's favour brought the Potter into the Militia of the City, and in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof he was ſo incouraged and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by him, that he was put into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thriving, and a way to raiſe his Fortune. For <hi>Damas</hi> being made Commander in chief of the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> army which they emploied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
<hi>Agrigentines,</hi> when one of the Colonels were dead, he preferred
<hi>Agathocles</hi> to that Command, who had before ſhewed himſelf not unequal to ſuch an emploiment, being of a vigour and courage fit for great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He alſo had made himſelf conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among the
<hi>Vulgar,</hi> who <hi>alwaies look upon things extraordinary,</hi> by accuſtoming himſelf in all his military exerciſes, to uſe ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ſtrong arms as none elſe could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manage. But being now made Colonel, he had more advantage to get a popular name and eſteem among the Great and eminent, though not among the Good. And his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment rendred more conſpicuous all thoſe his other advantages which he had either by Nature or Art. He was of a comely preſence, and a large ſtature (which to the Vulgar are marks of Rule) an high and immoderate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He had a mixture of good and bad Arts. He was as well induſtrious as he was luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99302:34"/>not leſs popular then arrogant, baſe and infamous in his pleaſures when he gave himſelf to them, but ſollicitous and bold when he conceived it expedient; he was hazardous in his attempts, a deſpiſer of dangers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and paſſionate in his harangues, and ſo uſually prevailed upon the <hi>Multitude,</hi> who <hi>are more eaſily perſwaded and moved by what appears, then by what truly is:</hi> and he ſeemed to have all things requiſite for Fame, but an honeſt Soul. To all theſe at length was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that other advantage of <hi>Wealth and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are the keys to Greatneſs, and make the acceſſes to Honour more eaſie and open.</hi> For <hi>Damas</hi> dying, and leaving his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to his Widow, ſhe became the Wife of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and her Dowry put him into the Cenſe of the richeſt Citizens, and raiſed his deſires beyond the level of a private perſon: for having a long time been vexed with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and now ſuddenly grown wealthy, he could not well diſſemble the change of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but was immoderate in thoſe deſires which had by a long Poverty been hitherto ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>The unquiet ſtate of the Commonwealth, either by Factions at home or Wars abroad, gave him frequent opportunities of promoting his deſigns, and improving his eſteem among the Vulgar. For commotions in a State are<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99302:35"/>like Earthquakes, which as they ſometimes ſwallow up pieces of land that have been long inhabited, and much adorned with the arts and Edifices of men, ſo do they ſometimes thruſt forth into the world ſome new pieces of ground, which though barren at firſt, may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſame ornaments with thoſe which are loſt: ſo in Civil broils many ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſies and eminent Perſons are overthrown and deſtroied; and in their ſtead ariſe new men to receive the Honours and reverence of the people. No Societies are more ſubject to ſuch ſeditious commotions then <hi>Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Polities, where all things being carried by the rude, ignorant and popular breath, they are often managed by ambitious perſons to the ſhaking of the State, who endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm others, to raiſe themſelves. In ſuch a Commonwealth did <hi>Agathocles</hi> live, which was therefore more obnoxious to his Arts; and he neglected no advantage that ſeemed favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his deſign. Therefore the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> having decreed to ſend an Army to relieve the City <hi>Croton,</hi> that then was beſieged by the <hi>Brutii, Agathocles</hi> gets himſelf to be created by the publick ſuffrage a Colonel in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but the chief command was intruſted to <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> and <hi>Heraclides,</hi> men that had a long time lived by oppreſſion, rapine and blood, and had made themſelves powerful by excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crimes. In this ſervice
<hi>Agathocles</hi> having<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99302:35"/>behaved himſelf ſtoutly, was notwithſtanding, through the Envy of <hi>Soſiſtratus,</hi> denied thoſe Honours and rewards which he conceived due to his atchievements.</p>
               <p>This injury coming ſo croſs to his deſigns, as checking his courſe to popular eſtimation, he could not digeſt; but his ſpirit boiled with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hatred, that others ſhould have the Glory of that which he thought was the proper effect of his Valour, and that he ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely expoſed to fruitleſs dangers: nor was he leſs grieved at his Enemies Honour then at his own Wrong. Therefore to ſatisfie his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and to trie another way to Fame, which was to make himſelf great by enmities with great men, and for which he was alſo fitted by Nature, being of a round and ſmooth diſcourſe, skilfull in raiſing ſlanders, and bold enough to proſecute them, powerful at Factions and popular diſcontents; he leaves the Army and makes haſt home, where he challenges the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a free City, and accuſeth <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> and his party (of the greateſt Crime in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State) as invaders of the common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and ſuch as intended a Tyranny. But the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> neglected theſe accuſations; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe their Commonwealth was defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in its conſtitution, as having not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a way whereby ſuch accuſations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of their moſt potent Citizens might be<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99302:36"/>throughly examined, (which would have been much for the ſecurity of their Liberty, becauſe it would have terrified any conſultations and conſpiracies againſt it, and have opened a way and courſe by Law for Citizens to vent their paſſions and humours one againſt another, and not neceſſitated them to extraordinary waies and private force, which do ſoon ruine the Commonwealth;) Or
<hi>Soſistratus</hi> his greatneſs and ſucceſs had ſecured him againſt the force of any impeachment, ſo that the people were not willing to take notice of that crime which they could not puniſh, or of that deſign which they could not prevent. For <hi>ſometimes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are with more eaſe avoided when they are not underſtood, and are more dangerous in ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a perſon when known, then when they are onely in deſign.</hi> Or elſe the credit of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles</hi> was ſo low, that he could not raiſe a belief in any that he could be ſollicitous for the publick good; or that this was any thing elſe but a ſally of his factious Spirit. His at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts being ſlighted, he was forced to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his preſent Accuſations.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> returning home victorious from
<hi>Croton,</hi> the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> loſt more by the Victory then was ſought by the war; for he being proud with his ſucceſs, and conſcious of his own deſigns, and doubting that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of
<hi>Agathocles</hi> had made him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99302:36"/>to the peoples jealouſie and anger, he changes the form of the Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an
<hi>Oligarchy,</hi> eſtabliſhing the Supreme power in ſome few of the Nobleſs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf the chief of the party: by this way conſulting his own ſafety: it ſeeming evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to him there could happen nothing more diſmal in his enterpriſe, then what he was to expect in a modeſt and private condition. This though at firſt it ſeemed to ſecure
<hi>Soſiſtratus,</hi> yet was it of a pernicious conſequence both to himſelf and the City in the iſſue of it. For <hi>to change the Government and the accuſtomed Orders of a Society muſt needs offend many perſons; and where there are many malecontents, ſome wretched accident may be every day fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Beſides the Example it gives to others to the ſame attempts, which will adjuſt the moſt horrid practices that are done in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>Examples ſtay not where they began, and though at firſt they be admitted but in a part, yet at laſt invade the whole; and when men have once declined from the rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they are precipitate to that which is evil: no man conceiving that diſhonourable for him, which hath proved beneficial to another.</hi> So that this practice of
<hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> and his party did in ſome meaſure honeſt the future procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Agathocles</hi> againſt them, and licence his projects for Tyranny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:99302:37"/>Yet at preſent <hi>Agathocles,</hi> that had ſound no Juſtice from his Enemy when he ſerved under his command in the war, could not now expect ſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ity from him in peace, who had the whole power of the City, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> accuſations; and as formerly he felt his Envy, ſo he was now to fear his Revenge, and therefore forſakes the City. And becauſe he was thus obſtructed in his courſes to Principality at home, he intended to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it abroad. To this end he gathers up in <hi>Sicily</hi> a company of ſuch as were accuſtomed to robberies, by hopes of larger booties and more ſplendid rapines. Theſe he diſpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpecies of a juſt Army, dividing them into ſeveral Companies, and marſhalling them under diſtinct Leaders, to be the fitter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and execute his commands. With this thieviſh Army he ſails over into <hi>Italy,</hi> and watches all opportunities for ſpoil and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. The firſt that felt his attempts were the <hi>Crotoniates,</hi> for whoſe liberty before he had behaved himſelf ſtoutly even to envy: and now as if he had repented of his Vertue, or to ſhew that though he was not willing they ſhould ſerve others, yet he deſired they might be his Slaves, he endeavours to ſurprize their City. But being diſcovered and encountred, he was beaten back with great loſs of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. With ſhame and the reſt of his beaten forces he flies to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> where he with his <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99302:37"/>company were received into pay as mercenary Souldiers for the defence of the City. But his immoderate thirſt of Greatneſs, and his unquiet ſpirit, which grew more eager by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, would not let him reſt; <hi>(So pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is that hope which great deſires do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)</hi> that even there he practiſed to arrive at Principality, and inſtead of a Servant to become Maſter of the place. But his deſigns being divulged, he was caſhiered, and with his Faction and party driven out of the City.</p>
               <p>Thus everywhere unfortunate abroad, he is preſented by Fortune with an opportunity of returning home, and revenge on his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> were about that time in hoſtility with the City
<hi>Rhegium,</hi> and had ſent an Army to beſiege it under the Conduct of
<hi>Soſiſtratus. Agathocles,</hi> that was then maintaining himſelf and his ſmall party by Robberies, hearing of it, gathers together all the Exiles that were in thoſe parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Vagabonds and Thieves, and with ſuch forces attempts to raiſe the ſiege before <hi>Rhegium:</hi> and ſo happily accompliſhes it, that he broke the Army of
<hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> with ſo great a rout, that he became contemptible to the <hi>Syracuſans. The contempt of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth alwaies uſher in his ruine.</hi> For the people encouraged by his overthrow, and exaſperated by the inſolency of the <hi>Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99302:38"/>who had incurred the publick hatred, and animated by ſome ſecret practices of
<hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> took up arms, and forced <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> and his party, which were about ſix hundred, all Inſtruments or Members of the
<hi>Oligarchy,</hi> to quit the Government and City alſo: and then retrived their former <hi>Democracy,</hi> but with the addition of a Senate of ſix hundred, which ſhould conſiſt of the wealthieſt and graveſt of the people, who were to debate things of the weightieſt concernment. This change open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſafe return to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and greater hopes to ſeize upon the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, <hi>Soſiſtratus</hi> and his party being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, who were the greateſt obſtructions to his deſigns. And becauſe he wanted ſtrength to force the people, he applies himſelf to cheat them by the arts and waies of a Demagogue, by which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> before him had attained the Principality of that unquiet City. For there being in every Society two ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Nobleſs and the Populacy, they are carried with different and oppoſite humours. The Grandees ſtill ſeek after a power to oppreſs and command the lower and inferiour part of the Community; and the People ſtrive for that liberty that they may neither be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor oppreſſed. And by means of theſe diſtant and oppoſite humours moſt part of the Tyrannies did ariſe. He therefore who intends to uſe the people for his aſcent to power, muſt<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99302:38"/>be frequent in his harangues, flatter the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, bitterly inveigh againſt the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Optimacy,</hi> extol the name and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Liberty, and make large promiſes of peace and plenty in the counſels he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and this is to be a Demagogue. For ſuch an one ſpeedily becomes the leader of the ignorant <hi>multitude,</hi> who <hi>are eaſily deceived by ſpecious promiſes, and the accuſations of ſuch whom they hate, and conceive him to be very juſt that favours their deſires,</hi> which have more of honeſty then thoſe of their adverſaries; and they do uſually give a power into his hands to ſuppreſs the contrary Faction, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards uſes to take away their Liberty.</p>
               <p>This way, which ſeemed moſt ſafe and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, did
<hi>Agathocles</hi> upon his return proceed in. Therefore when the news came that the <hi>Bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, Soſiſtratus</hi> and his party, aſſiſted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> did intend to make warre upon the
<hi>Syracuſans,</hi> he was frequent and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his Orations to the people, that they would not return again under the yoke of the
<hi>Oligarchy,</hi> but undertake the warre to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Liberty. Which being managed with the uſual arts did prevail upon the Multitude, and they decreed the warre: which continued a long time, and was varied with ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows and Victories. In this warre <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> ſometimes as a private perſon, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99302:39"/>as a Commander, did behave himſelf gallantly, and ſhewed himſelf to be a perſon of good Conduct, cloſe deſign, apprehenſive of all advantages, and ſpeedy in the execution, having alwaies in doubtful caſes ſome cunning Stratagem, either to baffle the enemy, or to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own party. Amongſt which this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for one. The <hi>Syracuſans</hi> having laid ſiege to <hi>Gela, Agathocles</hi> one night with a thouſand commanded men gets into the town by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. <hi>Soſiſtratus,</hi> that then was Governour of the place, being alarmed by the ſurprize, ſpeedily collecting the ſtouteſt and beſt-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd men of the Garriſon, ſets upon thoſe that had entred, and killing about three hundred of them, put the reſt to flight. Who being to make their retreat through very narrow lanes, were in great hazard of being all cut off, having neither room to fight, nor leiſure to flie.
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> beyond all hope frees them from this danger; for though he himſelf had received ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wounds, and was weakned with the loſs of much blood; yet not fearfully yielding to his preſent adverſity, he gives command to the Trumpetters, that they ſhould go to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part of the town-wall, and there ſound a Charge: which being ſpeedily performed, the <hi>Geloans,</hi> that then preſſed hard upon <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> hearing the Charge given in another place, and through the darkneſs of the night not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to diſcover the truth of the matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99302:39"/>the City to be aſſaulted in another part by another body of the Enemy. This made them ſlacken their eagerneſs in aſſailing
<hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> and to divide themſelves to ſuccour the other parts which they imagined were aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and by this means ſuffered him and his party ſafely to return to their Camp: where he was received with much honour, for having preſerved the lives of ſo many of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from an evident ruine.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Agathocles</hi> abounded with theſe honeſt arts, he had trodden the right way to Glory; and would he have been contented with what the Laws and his Country would give, he might have received that as a reward of his Vertue which he laboured to make a ſpoil of his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and by the common conſent have been thought worthy to reign, if he had not ſought it too greedily. So <hi>Gelo</hi> before him, and <hi>Hiero</hi> after him, received the Empire of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> as a reward of their generous actions, not as the aim of their deſigns. And <hi>Timoleon,</hi> though he ſtrove to be a private perſon, yet was forced to be a Prince. <hi>Heroick Vertues being as the Patent of Heaven for Dominion: and men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit to them that receive, not take the Power; and think their Freedome preſerved, not infringed, by a juſt Prince, there being no greater Liberty then to be well governed.</hi> But the deſire of Greatneſs was too importunate
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99302:40"/>in <hi>Agathocles.</hi> For <hi>ambitious ſpirits are not eaſily contented with what is offered; to whom the preſent enjoyments ſeem contemptible, when greater things may be hoped for; and at laſt they endeavour too haſtily to exceed their own hopes: which is the ruine of many, that might have attained to Supremacy, had they not preferred too ſpeedy and dangerous courſes to ſuch that are more ſlow, yet ſure, mediums to power.</hi> And therefore theſe arts which would have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered moderate crimes in others, made him more ſuſpected by his Citizens, that he was a perſon of too bold hopes, and no longer fit to dwell in a free City: for he made uſe of all his Succeſſes and abilities to render himſelf great in the common fame, and popular among the Souldiers. So that his Vertues, as well as his Vices, made him unfit for that Society. For <hi>Induſtry and Sagacity are no leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then Vanity and Luxury to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, when they are uſed to attain a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent therefore the ambitious deſigns of this and other her Citizens, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> had invited from
<hi>Corinth Aceſtorides,</hi> a perſon of a clear fame and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned Honeſty, to take upon him the Government for a time, that he might ballance the ſeveral Factions of their State, and give vent to thoſe ſwelling hopes of her moſt turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99302:40"/>members, who now were grown too big for a civil and ordinary management; hoping to find him like to
<hi>Timoleon,</hi> that knew how both to conquer Tyrants, and to ſubmit to a civil Government, a rare agreement in one breaſt: for <hi>the nature of man is willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge that in himſelf which he hates in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But
<hi>Aceſtorides,</hi> though he wanted not integrity for his truſt, yet failed in courage and reſolution to perform it. For finding
<hi>Agathocles</hi> the greateſt object at that time of the common jealouſie, and that Liberty and he were inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent in one City, (For
<hi>that City cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted free, where any one Citizen can terrifie the publick Magiſtrates,</hi>) he did not dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him by a Trial and courſe of Juſtice, but intended to take him off by a ſecret Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and therefore publiſhed an Edict, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he baniſhed him from that Commonwealth; and commanding him to leave the City by night, he laid an Ambuſh in the way that might kill him in his paſſage, ſuppoſing the darkneſs would conceal the authors of his death, and his Baniſhment would occaſion an uncertainty in all reports that ſhould be divulged, whether he were alive or dead, and ſo ſuſpend the minds of the Vulgar rabble (to whom his Vices as well as his Vertues had indeared him, and) who would be forward to mutiny in his revenge. <hi>Agathocles,</hi> that was not unacquainted with any fraudulent practices, did eaſily ſuſpect the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99302:41"/>plot: and therefore to prevent it, chuſeth out one of his ſervants that was moſt like to himſelf in the outward proportion of body, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes him with his own armour, mounts him upon his own horſe, and ſends him out of the City that way which he conceived was forelaid, and he himſelf diſguiſed with poor and ragged apparel departs in a more unfrequented path. Thoſe that were appointed to diſpatch him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing by the arms and horſe that they had encountred with their deſigned prey, ſet upon the Servant and kill him, ſuppoſing that they had rid
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> of their fears and hate. But <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s following actions ſoon made them ſenſible of their errour, and did upbraid the weakneſs of <hi>Aceſtorides,</hi> who did not dare to uſe the ſword of Juſtice againſt him whom he thought unworthy to live, and put the ſecurity and Liberty of the Commonwealth upon the uncertainty of a Plot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> being gone, the unſteady multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude grow weary of that warre which he had perſwaded them unto againſt the
<hi>Banditi,</hi> who aſſiſted by the power of <hi>Carthage,</hi> were able to renew their invaſions after many defeats. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they immediately receive them into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again, and conclude a Peace with the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians:</hi> but revoked not the ſentence of Baniſhment againſt <hi>Agathocles,</hi> which now by the return of his enemies he conceived would<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99302:41"/>be irreverſible. He therefore hath recourſe to his old auxiliaries of Thieves and deſperate Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, whom neceſſity and his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had fitted for any Villany; who readily flocked about him in hopes of more licentious rapines: and to theſe he gathers all the disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Souldiers, whom the preſent Peace had made uſeleſs, and forming an Army of theſe, he grew terrible both to the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> waſting their Territories, firing their Villages, and plundering the weaker and unfenced Towns and Cities. And that he might colour his outrages with ſome pretext of Juſtice, he eſpouſed the quarrels of all thoſe Cities that were either enemies to or emulous of the power of <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> &amp; to this end was made Praetor of the <hi>Murgantines,</hi> who had an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hatred againſt them, and had been his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in his Baniſhment. Under the ſpecies of their quarrel he did ſo eagerly proſecute the warre and his own deſigns, that he took
<hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and blocked up <hi>Syracuſe</hi> it ſelf. This reduced them to ſuch ſtreights, that they were forced to ſeek for ſuccour and aid from <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General. He, either to keep alive thoſe flames wherewith the <hi>Sicilians</hi> did conſume one the other, was willing to adde ſome fewel to the fire; or elſe in humanity and of a generous ſpirit, would aſſiſt a noble, though adverſe, City, when diſtreſſed by her own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; ſending thither ſuch a ſufficient ſupply<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99302:42"/>as made <hi>Agathocles</hi> deſpair by force to bring it to his ſubjection. He therefore applies himſelf to his more ſafe and ſecret arts of deceit; and deſires <hi>Amilcar</hi> that he would mediate betwixt him and <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> that he might be reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his own City and houſhold Gods, and not be neceſſitated by ſuch unpleaſing waies to preſerve his life and liberty. But together with theſe honeſt pretexts, he made more obliging promiſes of ſervice and gratitude to <hi>Amilcar,</hi> if he would be the happy inſtrument of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amilcar</hi> undertakes the office, and eaſily perſwades the wretched <hi>Syracuſans</hi> to conſent to that which, without his aſſiſtance, they ſhould be forced to ſubmit unto upon more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal conditions. His reſtitution therefore was agreed unto by the People, upon ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of their Peace and Liberty; which to give them, he was led into the Temple of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> the moſt ſacred Deity among the
<hi>Sicilians,</hi> and there ſolemnly ſwore, that he would doe nothing contrary to the <hi>Democratical</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> This was the onely ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they could at that time have from
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles.</hi> Which is indeed a ſufficient tie upon ſuch ſouls as are indued with a ſenſe of Vertue, or have any fear of a Deity: but Oaths are too weak fetters to reſtrain ambitious Spirits, or ſuch as intend a Tyranny. For <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99302:42"/>to be unjuſt towards men, will ſlight the teſtimony and vengeance of Heaven.</hi> But though the people had been acquainted with the Arts and impiety of Tyrants, and were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the impious converſe of him whom they admitted; (For <hi>from the former converſation may be beſt valued the force of any mans oath</hi>) yet were they now in ſuch a condition, that it was as dangerous not to believe as to be deceived: and they choſe rather, as conceiving it a relief of their miſeries, to be undeſervedly abuſed, then to leave him any colour of juſtice for his Injuries.</p>
               <p>But it was the greater Wonder among the <hi>Speculativi,</hi> that <hi>Amilcar,</hi> a perſon of ſuch experience in humane converſe, and by a long Government not unacquainted with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of aſpiring minds from their Oaths and Promiſes, that he ſhould rely upon the Oath of
<hi>Agathocles;</hi> who likewiſe ſwore to him by touching the kindled Tapers, (the form of ſwearing among the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) that he would promote the <hi>Punick</hi> intereſt, and obey their commands. For how could he imagine that a Perſon ſo faithleſs to his own Country, would obſerve any faith with ſtrangers? that he which ſought for Dominion in his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would quietly bear a forein yoke? Yet the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> might promiſe to himſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to his Republick either from the Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99302:43"/>or Obſervance of the Tyrant. If he were faithful, then the increaſe of his power over the <hi>Syracuſuns</hi> extended the Dominon of the <hi>Africans,</hi> and would give ſome ſplendour to their yoke, in that they had a King for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of ſlavery. If otherwiſe he ſhould be falſe to both, then might
<hi>Carthage</hi> rejoice at his Perjuries, becauſe they would occaſion eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hatreds and quarrels among her common enemies, and ſo make her Victory eaſie when ſhe ſhould attempt it. And it would be more advantage for the <hi>Punick</hi> Empire, if <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> together with infamy and hate ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the power of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> then if he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it by vertuous actions, and had been ſeated in it by the people's affections; for ſo being mutually jealous, they would afflict and weaken each other, that at laſt the Tyrant would not be able to hold his Uſurpation, nor the City to maintain her Liberty: ſo that in the end it muſt neceſſarily fall into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Theſe might be the too ſubtle ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fine hopes of <hi>Amilcar:</hi> but <hi>they could never be eſteemed wiſe counſels, wherein ſo many accidents might intervene, as might juſtly make him doubt of the expected iſſue.</hi> For the Tyrants Cruelty and Fortune eluded all his hopes, and juſtified the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Cenſure, who for this action condemned their Commander.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99302:43"/>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> being returned home, covered his revengeful and ambitious Soul with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Modeſty, neither awakening the fears of the people, nor raiſing the jealouſies of his enemies by complaints of his unjuſt baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the unprovoked injuries which he had received; but burying all in ſilence, as if the love of his Country had defaced all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate animoſities, he rendred all ſecure, and ſuffered them to embrace that errour, <hi>That Malice may be worn out with time, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed by Benefits.</hi> And knowing that the ſpeedieſt way to overthrow the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was to pretend Liberty, and when the Government was once ſhaken, it might eaſily be attempted on; he applies himſelf to ſuch courſes as might render him in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar eſteem the Patron and aſſertor of the common Liberty. Therefore in all his harangues he ſtill expreſſed his great affection to the people. Who being moſt eager in two deſires, one, of having their Liberty, and the other, of taking revenge on thoſe that are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their bondage; he tickles and feeds theſe two humours in his ſpeeches, pleading the great equity of reſtoring the Government to the multitude, that every free-man ſhould have his ſhare in the common intereſt; and then inveighs againſt thoſe that had been and were in power, accuſing their inſolencies and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in Government, and ſo forms his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99302:44"/>as one that rather knew how to rule, then deſirous of it. For <hi>he that accuſes would be ſuppoſed clear in himſelf from what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to another as a crime, and he is conceived skilful in that wherein he obſerves anothers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi> Thus playing the ſubtle Demagogue, and doing all things as a Slave, that he might arrive at Rule, with more ſafety and ſpeed he attains that which open and ſtout aſſaies would have rendred difficult. And
<hi>he that will ariſe from a private and low condition to the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt fortune, muſt uſe more Art then Force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people cheated by theſe his ſpecious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of a perfect Liberty, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joled by his reiterated proteſtations of ſeeking onely the common utility, ſoon forgot their former jealouſies, and his bold attempts upon their Liberty; <hi>(So ſtrong an influence hath a confident aſſertion even upon diſtruſtful minds, that it works a belief of what they deſire, though contrary to the evidence of reaſon drawn from former experience)</hi> and bewitched with the imaginary benefits of Novelty, which the Vulgar are no leſs deſirous of in a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered then in a corrupted State, did by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Decree make him their General, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute him their Conſervator of the Peace, till ſuch time as a form of Government ſhould be framed that might ſatisfie all parties, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Liberty and Unity among all the members<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99302:44"/>of the Commonwealth. For all the Exiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned home, the City was diſtracted with various Factions, and could not agree in any one form of State. Every one, as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, projecting ſeveral methods conducing to the intereſt of his own party, and the ruine of the oppoſite; very little reſpecting the publick ſecurity. And when all would order the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, none could pleaſe: for ſome of their Forms did not pleaſe thoſe that were good, and others diſpleaſed the wiſe. In ſome it was made eaſie to doe miſchief, and in another men could not ſafely doe that which was good. One left too much authority to the Grandees, and the other made the Populacy tyrannical and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary. Therefore <hi>the multitude, which are ſlow in their reſolves, unleſs determined by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> were now by the variety of propoſals more uncertain and dubious to make their choice. In the mean while each Faction ſtriving to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it ſelf, made an horrid confuſion in the Community. And as in a Tempeſt each wave ſtriving to be higheſt rides upon the back of that which haſted to the ſhore before it, and is it ſelf alſo ſuppreſſed by a following: ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Civil Tempeſt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; each party ſtrove to ſuppreſs the other, till a third, undiſcerned before, aſſaults and ſuppreſſes the Conquerour. And each was made more fierce by their ſeveral pretenſions to Liberty and the Publick good, which even
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99302:45"/>thoſe that aimed at the ſevereſt Tyranny would not neglect: ſo that all thinking to evidence the goodneſs of their Cauſe by their heat for it, filled the whole City with tumult and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The Diviſions ran ſo high, and continued ſo long, that the ſoberer part thought it was now expedient, that the afflicted Republick ſhould have ſome reſt, leſt the wounds thereof ſhould be made wider by ſuch a tumultuous way of curing. And it appeared that the onely way to attain Order was, to conferre and intruſt into ſome One man's hand power to preſerve the peace for a time: for it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it was almoſt impoſſible, in ſo great a diſtraction, things could ever come to a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, unleſs ſome One, like a Soul and Mind, ſhould give Order and Method to all the reſt. The perſon choſen for this was
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles,</hi> who was ſtill on that party where was the greateſt Number, which was likely to be the moſt ignorant, and which he conceived he could moſt eaſily delude. He therefore was made Praetor, and intruſted with more then ordinary power for this great work of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus was
<hi>Agathocles</hi> preſented with the faireſt opportunity of true Glory that his Soul could poſſibly deſire. For <hi>Heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give nor any man wiſh for a fitter occaſion for worldly Glory, then to find a City deformed<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99302:45"/>with confuſions, and declining to ruine by its corruptions, which he may reform</hi> and module with wholeſome Laws and generous Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to render it a peaceable habitation, and make it a theatre of Vertue and Juſtice; to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Magiſtrates of their Honour, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private perſon of his Wealth and Safety: for this is to be emulous and a rival of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven, to bring Order out of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to diſpenſe thoſe bleſſings which render Life comfortable, and hedge up the fortunes and goods of men with a juſt providence. This captivates the Souls of men to a voluntary ſubjection, and challenges an un-envied ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who was of the temper of every Tyrant, meaſuring the benefit of his Power by a licence to doe miſchief, &amp; being no leſs thirſty of Blood then he was of Greatneſs, perverted theſe advantages of ſolid Glory to gratifie his Luſts, conſulting his own eternal ignominy in his Countries ſlavery. And therefore reſolved not to let ſlip this ſeaſon of erecting his Tyranny, to which all things in the judgement of his Luſts did ſeem to invite him. The people whom he had to deal with were factious and unquiet, reſtleſs as the Sea which did incompaſs them; whom the plenty of their ſoil and the riches of Trading had made ſo wanton, that they were impatient of<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99302:46"/>Laws and Magiſtrates: and as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to endure Slavery, ſo they were immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in the uſe of their Liberty; and by theſe Corruptions were become like ſo many wild beaſts, eaſie to be taken by any watchful and bold hand that could hope to tame them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the frequent revolutions of Government, and the ſucceſſive inundations of ſeveral Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had each in their Order, like the Overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Nile,</hi> left ſo many ſeeds and ſpawns of monſters that might eaſily be formed to any deſign; ſo many diſappointed in their hopes and broken in their fortunes, that they would be contented to be inſtruments of any change that ſhould make them whole again. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were for the moſt part mercenary, and without any diſcipline; for <hi>in Civil warres the diſcord of the Citizens aboliſhes the ſeverity of diſcipline:</hi> beſides, being now to be caſhiered, becauſe they were made uſeleſs by this Peace, they were envious at the rich Citizens, and did meditate nothing elſe but the ſacking of the Town, the pillage of the Country, and the murdering of their Enemies; and ſo were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for any bold corrupter, that would but lead them to their deſired prey. But the moſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Occaſion was the preſent unſetledneſs of the Government, all things being but in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to compoſure, not yet eſtabliſhed; which is a vaſt advantage for any wicked enterpriſe, whoſe counſels and hopes are built upon trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99302:46"/>All theſe Occaſions promiſed much eaſe in the deſign, and there was nothing that he feared would much impede his aſcent to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, but the Authority of the Senate of ſix hundred, which were the wealthieſt <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> and of greateſt credit with the people, which he intends to remove out of the way; not willing any longer to delay, when caution ſeemed more dangerous then raſhneſs, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to loſe theſe <hi>Occaſions</hi> which Modern Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants name the <hi>Calls of Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All things therefore ſeeming fit for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being now Chief Magiſtrate, no empty name, but of great moment to execute any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and having an actual command of all the forces of the Commonwealth, he wanted onely ſome pretext to draw them together, with as many as he thought fit for his deſign, which either Fortune preſented him with, or he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf formed. For news was brought to <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> that ſome under their dominion had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from their obedience, and were embodied about <hi>Erbita.</hi> Upon this the people were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in great haſt, who ſurpriſed with this ſudden fear, paſſed a Decreee, that
<hi>Agathocles</hi> ſhould take care of the Commonwealth; and that he might prevent the danger with ſpeed, he might levy what Souldiers he thought fit.</p>
               <p>This Commiſſion was as large as his deſires,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99302:47"/>and he preſently makes uſe of it to his purpoſe: for he ſends for the <hi>Murgantines,</hi> who were his ancient friends, but bitter enemies of the <hi>Syracuſans;</hi> he gathers up out of the in-land Towns ſuch as had been his former comrades in his thieviſh expeditions; and with theſe he joins thoſe that had formerly ſerved under him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who he knew were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him by former Benefits, fit for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he dared to command, that were of a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious faith to him, but enemies to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and haters of the people, becauſe they were forced to obey their commands: which hatred was therefore more fierce, becauſe it was unjuſt. All theſe made up a number of three thouſand, every one of which were very deſirous to ruine the
<hi>Democracy.</hi> To theſe he adds ſuch of the Citizens as had no honeſt hopes, whoſe poverty or fear of puniſhment for former offences did make them malign and hate thoſe that were in Power, and ſuggeſt to them a neceſſity of becoming greater crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, that by the change of Government they might gain ſecurity, and in licentious tumults alter their deſpicable fortunes by the booties and rewards of civil commotions.</p>
               <p>Theſe all being fit for his purpoſe, as if he intended his march towards <hi>Erbita,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to rendezvous at the Tomb of
<hi>Timoleon;</hi> as if he would firſt trample upon the aſhes and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99302:47"/>memory of him that had been the moſt Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſertor of Liberty to that wretched City, and from thence make his invaſion by Blood and Violence. His Army being met, he ſends for
<hi>Peiſarchus</hi> and <hi>Decles,</hi> who were the moſt eminent and leading members of the Senate, as having ſomething to conſult with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the publick affairs. They coming to him with a train of about forty of their friends, were immediately ſecured by a guard that he ſet upon them, as if they had come to execute ſome Treaſon againſt him. Then calling his Souldiers together, and appearing among them with a countenance compoſed to ſadneſs, he omits nothing that might move either pity to him, or fear, anger, and hate towards the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He invokes their faith and compaſſion of him, and complains of his hard Fate, that it was never ſafe for him to love the People, and that none was ever an enemy to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but they would be likewiſe the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his deſtruction.

The caitiff Army having this full licence to ſatisfie their revenge, covetouſneſs and luſt, ſoon fell to the execution, and left nothing undone that a conquered City feels from an enraged Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. They guarded all the poſts of the City, and ſhut up the Gates that none might eſcape their fury: then they ſlew all the moſt daring and popular Citizens, who hearing the tumult came forth unarmed into the ſtreets to inquire the cauſe. Then the houſes ſtreamed with the<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99302:49"/>blood of the owners, the Innocent fell with the Guilty, and every one was ſlain that had ſomething to ſatisfie the expectation of his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. He that had no enemy, met with death at the hand of his friend; and a good name was a mark for ruine. The Altars of the Gods were coloured with the blood of thoſe that fled to them for refuge, as Victimes to an incenſed Deity. The aged men and ancient matrons were led about in ſcorn, by their miſeries to make up the merrier part of this Tragedy. And that nothing of unhappineſs might be unfelt by the miſerable <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> Rapes were mingled with Slaughters: he that was the Aſſaſſinate of the Husband, would be the Raviſher of the Wife; and he that reeked with the blood of the Father, would quench his flames of luſt with the diſhonour of the Daughter. Their rage and luſt was ſo high againſt the people, that at laſt it grew hot among themſelves, and he was accounted an enemy that had got the more precious booty. When any Virgin or Youth, whom beauty made conſpicuous, fell into the hands of this barbarous rabble, they were commonly torn in pieces by the violence of thoſe who contended for their firſt abuſe; and then became the quarrel, and armed the Raviſhers to their mutual ruine. Others while they haſted away with the gold and ſilver of the murdered owner, were themſelves a prey to a ſtronger arm. Thus death and ruine reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99302:49"/>in
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the firſt day there were no leſs then four thouſand of the moſt eminent Citizens, that by honeſt arts had won the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the people, murdered. Some were apprehended and ſlain at the gates, through which they thought to flie. Others met death from which they fled in climbing over the town wall, by too much fear and haſt breaking their necks and limbs. About ſix thouſand eſcaped, and ſome of them got ſafe to <hi>Agrigentum</hi> and other neighbouring Cities, where the relation of their miſeries did move a great deal of pity: but the inhumane Souldiers would yet make them ſenſible of their fury in their remaining parts, with more contumely raviſhing their Wives and Daughters, becauſe they themſelves had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped with their lives.</p>
               <p>This Cruelty laſted for two daies, <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s thirſt of blood being not ſooner to be quenched; or becauſe his authority was not yet ſo great as to forbid thoſe crimes which he might with eaſe command; or he was willing to indulge the lufts of his Army beyond all hopes of pardon, that ſo they might not expect ſafety but in the conduct and preſervation of him who had authorized their wickedneſs. But when this baſe rabble of men did ſeem to be ſatiated with villany, as having no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to practice on, to conclude the Tragedy, he ſends for all thoſe Citizens whom he had<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99302:50"/>ſecured, and who had been reſerved to feed his own eyes with their blood.

For even the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and bloodieſt villains, in diffidence of a change of affairs, will provide ſome private favour againſt the publick hatred.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s firſt ſcene of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and by ſurveying theſe ſacrifices to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the ſtate <hi>Augurs</hi> and prudent <hi>Greeks</hi> did form a judgement how bloody and cruel would be the proceſs of his Government.

               <p>For either by his wicked practices to attain<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99302:50"/>to it, his Soul will be habituated to miſchief; or his deſires to keep what he hath uſurped will preſent to him a neceſſity to continue as he did begin.

His Vices render him not more hateful to the good, then his Vertues doe to thoſe that have been the miniſters of his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, to whom, as well as to his own luſts, he muſt be ready to proſtitute the lives, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and goods of the beſt Citizens, and ſometimes his choiceſt friends, as to the authors of his fortune. So that the obſervation of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> is very true, <hi>Imperium flagitio acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nemo unquam bonis artibus exercuit:</hi> and it is apparent in the Life of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and verified in every Uſurper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> having laid his foundation by rude cruelty, builds the Superſtructures w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: an art thought ſo neceſſary for thoſe whom Ambition makes thirſty or tenacious of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was well skilled in it, eſteemed it among his choiceſt Vertues; alwaies<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99302:51"/>appearing a modeſt refuſer of what he paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſired; and when all things elſe died in him, he ſtrove to keep his diſſimulation alive.
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> by this onely Art arrived to the Greek Empire, and had found it ſo proſperous, that he made uſe of it when the enraged Multitude were in actual revenge of that Imperial and Patrician blood which he had ſpilt, and as he was led to Execution, continued his feigned Piety, crying out, <hi>Break not a bruiſed reed:</hi> as if he thought diſſimulation ſo powerful a charm, that it would calm a tumult, and that anger and fury had left a place for credulity. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince of ſuch an impatient Ambition, that he could not bear with a private condition though in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Crown, while his Father lived, nor defer the jealouſies of his own Son, till his age might make him more aſpiring and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Dominion, had made ſuch uſe of this artifice, and was ſo ſucceſsful in it, as by it onely he ruined his too powerful enemy <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> and therefore commended it to the Tutors of his Son, as the onely leſſon he ſhould learn in Latine,

Agathocles</hi> was as great an Artiſt in this as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, it being as neceſſary for him as for all thoſe who project wicked deſigns, and whoſe abject condition or hainous crimes have ſet them at a great diſtance from glorious hopes.<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99302:52"/>For
<hi>noble actions and juſt titles have no need of diſſimulation, and generous ſpirits will ſcorn to uſe it; becauſe it is an evidence of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a conviction of fear.</hi> But Tyrants are never nice in any thing that is advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Therefore <hi>Agathocles,</hi> that feared a preſent and immediate exerciſe of rule would too ſoon diſcover the cheat he had put upon the people, and ſo make his ſettlement more difficult, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to delude them, that they ſhould even force him to take that which he ſo eagerly thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and bind the yoke of Slavery on their necks by their own Suffrages, and by their own Law give him ſuch a power that ſhould force their obedience. For though the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be eaſily perſwaded to any thing, yet it is difficult to keep them conſtant in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion without a power over them. <hi>Nothing is more unſtable then Greatneſs founded onely upon anothers pleaſure; nor are the favours of any more uncertain then thoſe of the Vulgar:</hi> therefore though he would be raiſed by them, yet would he not be built upon them. To bring this about, he veils his deſigns with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled <hi>Modeſty.

<hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, and more equal diviſion of lands, that all debts and bonds ſhould be cancelled, and that Priſoners upon ſuch obligations ſhould be ſet at Liberty. Which are the uſual tempting promiſes whereby Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers raiſe the hopes and get the favour and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the debauched rabble: but they take as little care to perform them, as they intended faith when they promiſed them. And ſuch are the good People which Tyrants ſo affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately mention, and are the authors of their power and ſupports of their Empire.</p>
               <p>The honeſter and middle ſort of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whoſe obſcurity and unenvied fortune had ſecured them in the Maſſacre, and whoſe ſpirits were not ſo high as to render them ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Tyrant, nor ſo abject as to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtruments of his Luſts, were ſo ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the horrour of that Cruelty which yet was in their ſight, and affrighted into a ſluggiſh patience, that though they abounded with indignation as well as grief for the loſs<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99302:55"/>of their Liberty, yet they feared the power and multitude of their enemies, ſo that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their paſſions, and deferred their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge till a fitter ſeaſon, thinking it more ſafe for the preſent, rather to expect then provoke their fortune. Others preferred preſent peace and ſecurity to glorious attempts with hazard. To ſecure and quiet theſe mens minds, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely forbad the murders and rapines of his party, as if he would put an end to all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For <hi>injuries, though great, yet if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated at once, and not every day renewed, do leſs affright and offend the minds of men.</hi> Then to beget in them a credulity that he would behave himſelf but as a common Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, with modeſty and civil gravity uſing that power which he had ſo barbarouſly got, he compoſes himſelf to all popular courſes: he ſpeaks familiarly to all; ſome he cajols with fair and ſplendid hopes; others, whom he judged more fit for buſineſs, and whoſe Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very he might buy with profit, he prefers to ſuch and ſuch places; and to moſt he uſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attractives, ſpecious in words, but void of any reality. In himſelf nothing appeared new or arrogant. He forbore the uſe of a Crown (unleſs when he ſacrificed, which was as Prieſt, not as a Prince;) he did not take to himſelf a ſelect Life-guard, either for Majeſty or ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: nor did he affect to make addreſſes to him difficult, nor delighted in the tedious attendance<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99302:55"/>of petitioners: which are the ceremonies of Greatneſs, and the pleaſures of weaker Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. But appearing in all the ſhapes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and preſenting theſe pageants of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he bound the yoke of Slavery ſtronger. For while he neglected theſe ſhadows of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he laid a foundation of ſolid power. He diverted all his care to regulate and augment the publick Exchequer, all the ſtores he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and filled the Magazines with arms and ammunition, and increaſed the Navy. For he foreſaw his new Principality muſt expect ſeditions at home, and invaſions from abroad: and if Fortune ſhould diſperſe them, yet would not his proviſions be fruitleſs, for with them he might make ſome additions to his Dominion, and when Slavery was faſtned at home, he might impoſe it abroad. Which he might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe to himſelf: for <hi>The firſt ſteps to Power are alwaies the moſt difficult; but when once that is entred on, there will not be wanting means and inſtruments to increaſe and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe courſes did <hi>Agathocles</hi> endeavour to draw the minds of men. But to thoſe that knew the Arts of Tyrants, theſe falſe Vertues were more terrible, becauſe they did but for a time ſuppreſs thoſe Vices which with more fury would afterwards break forth. For in ſo much pride and cruelty there can never be civility<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99302:56"/>and gentleneſs without deſign. It is reckoned among the ſafer Arts of Tyrants, to imitate a good and lawful Prince. But in every imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there is ſomething which betraies the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence upon nature, and diſcovers it not to be genuine: ſo that notwithſtanding all the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, a Tyrant's bloody thirſt, horrid luſts and deſires of ſecurity and Greatneſs, will make him break forth into ſuch practices as will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the falſe colours and ſhadows of Vertue, and they will ſoon recoil to actions anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his principles; as did <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who in a ſhort time diſcovered to the whole world that he would not uſe that power for the benefit of men, which with their ſo great ruines and miſeries he had acquired.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Agathocles</hi> was labouring to take root, the
<hi>Syracuſan</hi> fugitives in thoſe Cities of <hi>Sicily</hi> where they found Sanctuary endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his overthrow, and to ſtir up all
<hi>Sicily</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Some out of a deſire to return to their native ſoil &amp; houſhold-gods, others to break the yoke under which their City groaned, and ſome out of hatred of <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s fortune more then his wickedneſs. <hi>It being an innate displeaſure in men, to behold the ſudden felicity of others, and to complain of the exceſs of their Fortune whom they have ſeen in the ſame level with themſelves.</hi> From theſe different princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples every one in his place of refuge, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99302:56"/>at <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> where their number was greateſt, endeavoured by the Demagogues and moſt popular Citizens to perſwade the Cities to a warre againſt the Tyrant. Theſe ſtill ſetting before the people in their harangues, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of preventing <hi>Agathocles</hi> with that warre which they were undoubtedly to expect from his ambition and covetouſneſs; the aſſurance of Victory from the weakneſs of his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the freſh hatred of his horrid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; the glory of the enterprize, to ſubdue and extinguiſh ſo great a Monſter, and reſtore ſo many miſerable Exiles to their own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-gods; the danger of the Example, if ſo near a wickedneſs ſhould paſs unpuniſhed. By theſe motives they eaſily prevailed upon the people to decree a warre againſt the Tyrant.</p>
               <p>But the greatneſs of the warre made the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſlow, which loſt the advantages that at firſt encouraged the enterprize. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſingle ſtrength, they entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with
<hi>Gela</hi> and <hi>Meſſene</hi> to the ſame warre: theſe Trcaties ſpent time in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and the confidence that did ariſe from their union did loſe more. For then, as not doubting the Victory, they feared that if they ſhould make any one of their own Citizens General of their Army, he might after the overthrow of <hi>Agathocles</hi> follow his Example, and either make himſelf Tyrant, or raiſe his<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99302:57"/>own City above the reſt. Therefore they would ſend ſome of the Exiles to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to procure from that City a perſon fit to be General of all their Forces. For they ſuppoſed a ſtranger would be more juſt and faithful in his truſt, not having the ſame intereſts and parties that a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen might have; and they hoped to find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Timoleon,</hi> or one that ſhould compoſe his conduct after his Example. But the fortune of <hi>Sicily</hi> was not ſo benigne, for inſtead of a Deliverer they received an effeminate and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Oppreſſor, whoſe Vices betraied them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemies power.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Agrigentine</hi> Agents coming to <hi>Sparta,</hi> they found <hi>Acrotatus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> King of that City, who was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and importunate for this emploiment. For having incurred the hatred of the <hi>Spartan</hi> youth, becauſe he oppoſed the Decree of the Senate to pardon all thoſe that had not ſtoutly behaved themſelves in the warre with <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he was often aſſaulted by them, who conceived themſelves injured by his inſolency, and was continually afraid of their plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. He was therefore very ſollicitous for ſome forein emploiment, wherein by his abſence he might give vent to their paſſions, as if he had undergone a voluntary baniſhment, and by removing the object of their hate, blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> out the remembrance of their injuries. This<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99302:57"/>man the Agents accept of, whom nothing but the Nobility of his Family could commend, though his manners were extremely degenerate from the Vertue of the <hi>Spartan</hi> royal blood. He was inſolent and high in his ſpeeches, but baſe and cowardly in his actions; deſirous of fame, but neither skilful nor induſtrious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; prone to evil, and not cunning to conceal it; fierce and ſevere againſt anothers Vices, yet indulgent to himſelf in baſer luſts; envious at the Glory of another, as if it were his infamy, and yet a deſpiſer of his own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. His hatred was heightned by the glorious memory of his Anceſtors. For <hi>the baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents of worthy Parents, beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hate which is inſeparable from wickedneſs, are loaded with another, for that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed the ſtock from which they ſprung, and tainted that blood which they received pure.</hi> This was the Engine wherewith the <hi>Sicilians</hi> were to demoliſh the greatneſs of <hi>Agathocles:</hi> too looſe and weak a hand to dethrone a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, induſtrious, and ſubtle Tyrant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved his advantage, rather then his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>He having undertaken the emploiment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the counſel of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who were the Cenſors of the Royal family in
<hi>Sparta,</hi> with a few ſhips ſails towards <hi>Sicily:</hi> but by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Tempeſt he was forced into the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99302:58"/>ſea near the territories of the <hi>Apolloniates;</hi> where he trifles away his time in compoſing a peace betwixt them and
<hi>Glaucias</hi> an <hi>Illyrian</hi> King, that then did beſiege their City. From thence he ſails to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> where to loſe time more precious then unneceſſary aid could be to the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> by the credit of his birth and Country he prevails with that City to enter into the
<hi>Sicilian</hi> league, and to ſend twenty ſhips againſt the
<hi>Syracuſan</hi> Tyrant. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much loſs of time which was emploied in theſe Treaties, he comes to <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> where with much applauſe (as is uſual to the Glorious aſſertors of Liberty) and great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation he did enter upon his command. This expectation and opinion of the people (which wiſe men eſteem prejudicial to any emploiment; becauſe many can never correſpond fully unto it, men uſually deſiring more then can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which doth in time turn to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and infamy) this great undertaker did labour to increaſe by his confident boaſts, that he would ſpeedily ruine the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and finiſh that juſt war. But they ſoon found how vain were his boaſts and their hopes. For they perceived how he neglected all the deſirable opportunities of performing his truſt, and as if he were forgetful of his enterprize, the Dignity of his Extract, and the Honour of his City, he did endeavour to erect a more heavy Tyranny then that which he was deſired<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99302:58"/>to pull down. He was wholly debauched to every Luſt, and as it were with the air, he had changed the <hi>Laconian</hi> Temperance and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (eminent Vertues in the higheſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) into Laſciviouſneſs and Pride; more like a ſoft
<hi>Perſian</hi> then an hardy <hi>Spartan;</hi> abuſing the plenty and Beauties of <hi>Sicily</hi> with his Luſts and riots: by which profuſe courſes and by ſtealth, he alſo conſumed the common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the war. Nor did he abſtain from blood and injuries, as if thoſe who had called him for Liberty, knew nothing of it beyond the empty name. And to perpetuate his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, he reſolved to murder <hi>Soſistratus,</hi> who was the moſt likely to head the <hi>Sicilian</hi> fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. For he was the moſt eminent of the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Exiles, and had often comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Armies of his Commonwealth with honour and ſucceſs, being of the Nobleſs of that City, of a preſent courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not unacquainted with the Arts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of Tyranny, therefore the more able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve &amp; oppoſe ſuch deſigns. The <hi>Spartan</hi> having no colour to make him fall by the ſword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor daring to aſſault him by open force, uſes the fatal careſſes of a Tyrant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites him to a Feaſt; where when he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed him by wine and gluttony, he cauſes him to be murdered.</p>
               <p>The news of this Murder being divulged, the<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99302:59"/>whole City was filled with uproar, and the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Exiles, whoſe hopes and fortunes were built upon this war, and were therefore the moſt impatient at every diſappointment, were highly inraged at the Death of <hi>Soſistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> whom the common Calamity had indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, and from whoſe valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they hoped for a more ſpeedy return home. Theſe firſt aſſault <hi>Acrotatus,</hi> and by their example many more were drawn to the ſame attempt. So that the whole City being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together by this tumult, vote him out of his Office and Command; and to confirm their Decrees, they aſſault him with ſuch weapons as their preſent fury adminiſtred, as ſtones and the like, and dealt with him as a common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy never to be reconciled unto. For <hi>their offences are most hainous who diſappoint the conceived hopes of a ſoft and juſt Government; and the minds of men being fruſtrated in their reaſonable expectancies of good, are thereby the more implacable. Acrotatus</hi> ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unequal to the peoples violence, fled out of <hi>Agrigentum</hi> by night, and with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny haſted to <hi>Sparta,</hi> leaving behind him a diſcontented City, and all his broken hopes of Tyranny, of which he was more deſirous then capable. For to impoſe Slavery upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without a force greater then their reſiſtance, requires a dexterous wit to manage all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the preſent advantage, tedious arts,<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99302:59"/>and time to form a party, to get ſome fame of valour and vertue, and to be eſteemed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the peoples rights. Otherwiſe, though any one by the advantage of a truſt, may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a Principality and Tyranny, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long hold it without ſuch foundations. And as things that ſuddenly ſpring and grow have the ſhallower rooting, and are ſooneſt pulled up: ſo ſuch ſudden Tyrants are eaſily depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Which was the fortune of
<hi>Acrotatus,</hi> who by rioting and injuries would enjoy the Pleaſures of Tyranny, before he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Power. <hi>None are more apt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Liberty of the people, then ſuch who are vitious and debauched; for they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly think Principality but a ſecurity of great crimes: yet none are leſs able to compaſs their deſign. For he that will dare to attempt that which no honest man will, must be able to doe ſuch things which none but a prudent and ſtout man can perform. Cato</hi>'s obſervation of
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that he was the onely ſober perſon that did endeavour the overthrow of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, was an <hi>Augury</hi> and fear of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in that deſign. Thoſe that are otherwiſe qualified, though they may diſquiet and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Cities to ruine by their vain attempts, yet can never eſtabliſh themſelves in any Grandeur, nor meet with any other iſſue of their Deſigns then Deſtruction or Ignominy; as this
<hi>Spartan</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99302:60"/>This evil management of <hi>Acrotatus</hi> was not unknown to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> &amp; therefore he provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them not to fight, but waits when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would fall by their own vices: wherein he was not deceived, for the league was ſoon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the aſſociated Cities divided their Army, and recalled their forces. For <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies conſifting of ſeveral communities have ſeveral intereſts; and if they laſt ſo long till they have ſome proſperous ſucceſs, yet are they then broken by envy and jealouſies. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the firſt adverſe encounter immediately creates a fear that diſſolves them;</hi> and every one by private counſels will endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own ſafety. Whence it comes to paſs that the forces of many Confederates are leſs conſiderable, though more numerous, then thoſe which one ſingle Power is able to form and raiſe. And thus it happened with theſe Confederates: for the <hi>Tarentines</hi> recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led home their ſhips; and the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Cities not thriving in their firſt heat againſt the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, would no longer tempt their Fortune, but by the mediation of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> who was able to force the diſſenters and impoſe an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they conclude a peace with the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſan.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> not intending to diminiſh the Greatneſs of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving together with his power the envy and hatred of him would be increaſed, and ſo at laſt he would fall as an eaſie and rich prey to<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99302:60"/>the
<hi>Punick</hi> Empire, and thinking by this Peace he might ſecure the rights of his own City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hazards of war, concludes a Peace upon theſe Articles:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>That <hi>Heraclea, Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Himera,</hi> which were Greek Colonies, ſhould continue as before under the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Empire; that all the other Cities of

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this Tempeſt, that threatned the ruine of the new Tyrant, being ſo proſperouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, proved like thoſe winds, which if they are not violent enough to throw down, do advantage trees, by ſhaking them to a greater faſtneſs at the root. For it ſetled <hi>Agathocles</hi> upon his foundations; becauſe it having alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to provide all the means of ſafety, by ſo neceſſary an induſtry he was enabled for any enterpriſe. He had gotten together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Confederates and the Citizens of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> a choice Army of <hi>Mercenaries</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of thirty thouſand Foot, and three thouſand five hundred Horſe, and had ſtored himſelf with all kind of Arms. Theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being now no longer neceſſary for defence, he was reſolved, according to the Inftitutes of Tyranny, to employ in faſtning his Dominion at home, and increaſing it abroad, by invading all the neighbouring and leſs potent Cities: for<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99302:61"/>if he could bind his yoke upon all the Cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, he ſhould remove Liberty out of the ken, and ſo out of the hopes of <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> beſides, he ſhould increaſe his Revenues and Forces againſt another ſtorm which he foreſaw was coming from
<hi>Carthage.</hi> For from thence he had received Intelligence, that
<hi>Amilcar</hi>'s peaceful counſels were branded with ſiniſter interpretations; and although the Senate did not dare publickly to condemn him while he was in Command, yet had they paſſed their ſentences againſt him, and ſealed them up in their Urne, not to be publickly recited till he returned to a private Condition. <hi>Agathocles</hi> therefore eaſily concludes what their intentions muſt needs be towards himſelf; and therefore to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt their invaſion, he endeavours to prevent them in the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of as much of <hi>Sicily</hi> as he could, not deſpairing in time to graſp the Empire of the whole Iſland, if not by his own valour, yet he ſhould have no ſmall advantage from his Enemies vices, who he ſaw could not be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in their common defence, and when they fought ſingly for Liberty, they would at laſt all be Slaves.</p>
               <p>To proſecute this reſolution, as alſo to buſie his own vaſſals in reſiſting provoked Forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that they might vent thoſe paſſions on ſome common enemy which elſe would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99302:61"/>ſwell againſt him, he ſets upon, and eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters all his weaker neighbours, and vexes them with his oppreſſions. For <hi>a Tyrant is like that other judgement of incenſed Heaven, a contagious Peſtilence, which ſtill infects and ſpreads it ſelf upon all that are near unto it.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought theſe leſſer Cities under his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, his next deſign was againſt <hi>Meſſene,</hi> which had refuſed to be concluded in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Peace betwixt <hi>Agathocles</hi> and the other <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and did ſtill retain her juſt hatred of the Tyrant, and therefore was become a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Exiles. To deprive them therefore of this harbour, and to make the
<hi>Meſſenians</hi> repent even of their pity to the miſerable, he was reſolved to make them as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as their gueſts. To this end he ſends <hi>Paſiphilus,</hi> one of his Captains, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable party and ſecret inſtructions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the territories of
<hi>Meſſene,</hi> not uſing any publick declaration of hoſtility, leſt he ſhould give them time to prepare for their defence, or leiſure to conſult of honeſt means to ſatisfie his unjuſt anger; for he ſought not Peace with them, but their ruine; nor cared he for their friendſhip, but intended their ſlavery. <hi>Paſiphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> according to his Commands, unexpectedly falls upon their Country, ſurprizes many of their Citizens, waſtes and plunders all their Villages, and ſetting forth all his actions with every advantage of terrour, he affrights the<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99302:62"/>
                  <hi>Meſſenians</hi> to a Treaty, which under-hand he offered to them by ſome of his priſoners. When they came to treat, he remonſtrates unto them, that the cauſe of the War was their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring his Maſter's implacable enemies, the <hi>Syracuſan Banditi;</hi> and declares, that as they were unequal to his Prince as to the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the war, and ſo were to fear the moſt danger, ſo ſhould they loſe nothing by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, if they were diſpoſed to peace: that they were evil Counſellors to their Commonwealth, who adviſed them to a Confederacy with the deſpicable enemies of ſo potent a Prince.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſſenians</hi> conſidering the preſent ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and their own weakneſs, more then the faith of him with whom they had to doe, and hoping by this overture to end a dangerous war without any hazard to themſelves, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately decree that all the <hi>Syracuſan.</hi> Exiles ſhould forſake their City, and then they ſet open their gates to receive
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> who was now come to them with his Army. The Tyrant at his firſt entrance covered his inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane purpoſes with a crafty modeſty; and as if he had had no arms to force his deſires, by all ſeeming Humanity perſwades them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal all thoſe publick Acts and Decrees where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had baniſhed certain of their lewdeſt Citizens for notorious crimes, and which were now in his Army, the refuge of every villain.<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99302:62"/>Which when they had done, and received them in, who would be like a Garriſon to ſubject them to the Tyrant, he preſently ſends for all ſuch whom he knew, there &amp; at <hi>Tauromenium,</hi> to be leſs patient of Slavery, and had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed their hatred of him; all which being about ſix hundred he immediately ſlew: for foreſeeing the war he ſhould have with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he reſolved to deſtroy whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he could not truſt.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> too late found that there was no Humanity or Equity to be expected from a Tyrant, and when it was in vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed their cruel folly in driving out the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſan</hi> Exiles, who would have been an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impregnable guard againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their enemy; as alſo that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied their beſt and ſtouteſt Citizens, (for one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch hate a Tyrant;) and, which did moſt of all upbraid their weakneſs, that they had by their own votes put themſelves under the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and vileſt Miniſters of Slavery, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and profligate <hi>Banditi.</hi> But now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left but ſhame and indignation at their own Credulity and the Tyrant's baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who was not at all aſhamed, that by ſuch unworthy arts he had compaſſed his deſign. For Tyrants that ſeek after power, and not glory, that thirſt for blood more then an honeſt fame, refuſe not the moſt wicked, if they be alſo<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99302:63"/>compendious, waies to attain their ends. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Generous Spirits had rather maintain their Greatneſs by Juſtice, and eſteem that the moſt evident teſtimony of Valour and Power to be at once both great and good, and not by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to aſcend to ſuperiority. The
<hi>Romans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied a triumph to thoſe their Conſuls, who to overthrow their enemies had polluted their arms with unjuſt and wicked arts, and never accounted that a Victory which was infamous. <hi>Viriathus,</hi> they conceived, fell with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then he that finiſhed the war with buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life, and hired his ſervants to his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for he ſeemed to upbraid the <hi>Roman</hi> weakneſs, that could not overcome a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Thief by noble waies. And as they hated the unworthy waies of poiſon and Treaſon to finiſh a war; ſo while they were uncorrupted in their Diſcipline, they were Religiouſly ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the beginning of any: for they never ſent forth their Armies till they had ſought for juſtice in the tracts of Peace, and after the publick promulgation of their intent. Such alſo was the Integrity of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> before they had fore-warned their enemy to a defence. <hi>Machiavel</hi> commends the Simplicity of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Florentines,</hi> that enterprized no hoſtility on their neighbours, till they had by ringing a Bell for the ſpace of a whole moneth admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their enemy to a peaceable ſatisfaction, or a brave reſiſtance. But <hi>every Tyrant makes his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99302:63"/>war impious, if not in the cauſe, yet in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; and more like thieves then Princes, aim onely to deceive, not to conquer their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> being thus ſucceſsfully wicked at
<hi>Meſſene,</hi> deſigns <hi>Agrigentum</hi> for his next prey; his falſe Ambition not ſuffering him to continue that Peace which his Neceſſity had forced him to make with them. But the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of ſixty ſail of ſhips, hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the coaſts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> diverted his arms from revenge, on the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, whoſe Countries he waſted with fire and ſword, took ſome of their Garriſons by force, and others were delivered upon compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. This Hoſtility betwixt <hi>Carthage</hi> and
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> made <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> (who ſince
<hi>Soſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratus</hi>'s death was become the chief of the
<hi>Syracuſan</hi> Exiles) and the other Confederates, hope for the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Punick</hi> arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this reſtleſs Tyrant. To them therefore they ſent an Embaſſie, with bitter complaints againſt <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and invectives againſt <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles.</hi> The laſt they ſet forth as a mercileſs, perjured, and bloody Tyrant. The other they accuſed as a Traitor, that by ſecret compact had delivered up the lives and fortunes of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> friends into the hands of a moſt cruel enemy: and that as the earneſt of this Treachery,
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> a potent and rich City, an<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99302:64"/>emulous contender with <hi>Carthage</hi> for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was firſt betraied into his hands; and under the name of Peace many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Cities had ſince been expoſed to his rapines. If therefore that Mighty Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and wiſe Senate ſhould not be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous to puniſh their treacherous ſervant, and to quench the Tyrant's thirſt of Empire with his own blood, they would ſoon feel in <hi>Africk</hi> the diſmal effects of their neglect of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Embaſſie inraged <hi>Carthage,</hi> and they were more keenly reſolved to make <hi>Amilcar</hi> ſatiate their anger with an ignominious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But either by a natural or a voluntary death he prevented the unjuſt fury of his own Citizens, who had condemned him before he could plead his innocency. So barbarouſly ungrateful are moſt Commonwealths to their chiefeſt ſervants: who if they thrive abroad, are ruined at home by Jealouſie and Envy; if they are not ſucceſsful, then the Capricioes of Fortune are accounted the miſcarriages of their Generals, and their Unhappineſſes eſteemed for Crimes. None were more infamous in this way of cruelty then the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who often expiated the diſhonour of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow with their Commander's head.

               <p>
                  <hi>Dinocrates</hi> with the other Exiles waited not idly for the effect of their Embaſſie and the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> preparations, which they knew would be ſlow, but were very active for their own reſtitution. And therefore he ſent forth a party under the Command of
<hi>Nymphodorus</hi> to <hi>Centorippa,</hi> a Garriſon of
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> where he held a Correſpondence with ſome of the City, who promiſed to deliver up the town to him upon condition of reſtoring their Liberty. The Governour had diſcovered the plot, yet ſuffers
<hi>Nymphodorus</hi> to enter the town by night, where he cuts him off with his whole party. <hi>Agathocles</hi> was not more glad for the defeat of the Exiles, then for the opportunity he now had to ſeize upon the wealth of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as being ingaged in a Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which he greedily takes from them with their lives, as being too great lovers of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to breath in the ſame air with a Tyrant. This loſs broke not the courage of
<hi>Dinocrates,</hi> but he having yet about three thouſand foot and not leſs then two thouſand horſe, poſſeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of
<hi>Calaria,</hi> whether he was invited by a party of the City; where immediately he drives out the Faction that was for <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps before the Town. The Tyrant upon the firſt intelligence, ſent
<hi>Paſiphilus</hi> &amp; <hi>Demophilus</hi> with a party of five thouſand againſt him. Theſe<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99302:65"/>ingaging with the Exiles commanded by
<hi>Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and <hi>Philonides,</hi> who led the ſeveral wings of their Army, the victory was for ſome time doubtful: but at laſt the Tyrants fortune prevailed, for <hi>Philonides</hi> being ſlain, and his wing routed,
<hi>Dinocrates</hi> was forced to retreat. <hi>Paſiphilus</hi> in the purſuit kills many of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and recovers <hi>Calaria.</hi> Where, like his Maſter's ſervant, he omitted no act of cruelty and extortion upon the miſerable Citizens. For <hi>the Ministers of a Tyrant are educated by him to the nature of maſtives, that they ſhould one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fawn upon him that feeds them, and be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and bloody to every one elſe.</hi> Proud with this Victory, <hi>Agathocles</hi> haſtens with all the forces he could make to fight the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that were drawn out into the field, and had incamped on the hill <hi>Eonome.</hi> But the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> refuſing the battel, as expecting more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, he returns in triumph to
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> as being the confeſſed Maſter of the Field, and with the ſpoils he had taken from the two wretched Cities, he doth adorn the beſt of his Ships.</p>
               <p>Thus ſucceſs waited upon the ſword of
<hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles:</hi> his deſigns being ſtill crowned with an iſſue greater then his hopes, as if Fortune no leſs then <hi>Syracuſe</hi> were become his Slave. Had that ſlaviſh and prodigious Flattery been then invented, which our age hath heard practiſed<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99302:66"/>to a proſperous wickedneſs; he had been called the beloved darling of the Gods, and his creatures would have perſwaded the miſerable <hi>Sicilians,</hi> that Heaven had by this ſucceſs ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a grant of what by blood and perjury he had pre-uſurped. But this was too groſs a cheat to be impoſed even upon the lying <hi>Greeks,</hi> and flattering <hi>Sicilians:</hi> who though they ſhould have wanted ſo much light, as might fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the Patronage of iniquity was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with a Deity; yet common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation afforded them moſt clear evidences, that Adverſity and Proſperity do not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the differences of Good and Bad; and that the moſt uninterrupted Succeſs cannot cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine a wicked action to the purity of Vertue, which is the true and proper object of the love of Heaven: ſo that it would have been an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to undermine all honeſty, and root out Religion, to attribute the love of a Deity, which is the reward and ornament due to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice onely, to impious perſons, though never ſo proſperous. Beſides, they daily ſaw that preſent ſucceſſes are never intended by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Guider of the world, to be as hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to ſecure thoſe which receive them of a perpetual Felicity. So that neither his Love, nor his Laws of Right and Wrong could be read or interpreted by the changeable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady light which is found in Humane affairs. Some of thoſe whoſe ſober breaſts were never<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99302:66"/>betraied by a conſtant proſperity to inſolence, but have ſeriouſly conſidered the uncertainties of our mortal condition, have ſuſpected the Prodigality of their own fortunes, and been jealous even of the too much indulgence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and like wary Favorites, who doubting leſt the effects of their Prince's love ſhould be afterwards the object of his envy, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profeſſed a ſatiety in receiving, and offered to reſign what they feared they could not keep. So ſome of thoſe that conſidered the viciſſitudes of humane affairs have been ſo far from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting their ſudden and violent Proſperity for the evidence of the affection of Heaven, that they have doubted, whether by it they were marked out for the mockeries of Fortune, and that they were raiſed to ſuch an height, from whence there was no deſcent but by a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice. Some therefore have laboured to prevent their fortune, and leave her before they were left by her, and contemned her embraces, that they might not be ſenſible of her ſtrokes. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have thought to offer to their evil Genius, and by a voluntary loſs or diſſembled misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſatisfie their more adverſe deſtinies. Thus the <hi>Samian</hi> Tyrant with the loſs of his Ring would have bribed his fortune to no more diſmal change. And <hi>Auguſtus</hi> bounded the
<hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, for fear of provoking its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow; and to divert the envy of his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Jupiter,</hi> did diſſemble a poverty, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99302:67"/>yearly begge. But <hi>Agathocles</hi> grew inſolent with his preſent ſucceſs, and promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more gainful fruits of his wickedneſs then he had as yet received. But fortune that had thus far flattered him, did immediately forſake him, and diſcovered the hatefulneſs of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in a deſperate ſtate.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Carthaginians</hi> about this time awakened with the daily informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Agathocles</hi> ſucceſs, decreed to proſecute their war in <hi>Sicily</hi> more ſeriouſly, and to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon that glory and intereſt which they had there ſo long neglected. For they gave no heed to the ſad relations and Embaſſies of the <hi>Syracuſan Banditi,</hi> becauſe they knew ſuch mens hopes and deſires to return home made them believe and relate things far from truth: nor did they value the faith of Exiles, becauſe ſuch when they find other waies of reſtitution to their Country, do betray the intereſt of thoſe whom they have before excited to it, and ſo<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99302:67"/>render all thoſe perils and charges fruitleſs, which were at firſt undertaken for their ſakes and upon their promiſes. But when <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> had through their neglect prevailed ſo far, as that he could now ſlight their power and deſpiſe their forces, they were more ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to provide for that war. They make
<hi>Amilcar</hi> the ſon of <hi>Giſgo,</hi> one of their moſt eminent Citizens, their General. A Perſon of a well-tempered courage, in whom the ſtoutneſs of a Souldier was mixed with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that was requiſite for a Commander: he had been ſeldome unfortunate, but alwaies faithful, of Candour enough to reconcile and aſſure a doubtful friend, and of ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to force an obſtinate enemy. They allow him for this Expedition an hundred and thirty Gallies for ſervice, and ſend with him two thouſand of their own Citizens, among whom were many of their Nobleſs, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Libyans,</hi> one thouſand <hi>Tuſcan</hi> mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, one thouſand ſlingers of the Iſlands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Baleares,</hi> two thouſand Chariots, with ſuch a proportion of Mony, Arms and Corn as was thought convenient for the deſign. The greatneſs of their Army did almoſt aſcertain them of victory, and therefore they looſed from the Haven with that alacrity and jollity, as if they went to ſpoil <hi>Sicily,</hi> and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. But this power that ſeemed ſo terrible to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> became the mockery of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99302:68"/>winds: for in a ſudden tempeſt they loſt ſixty of their Gallies, two hundred Veſſels that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the proviſions, many of their Nobility, and a great number of their leſs conſiderable Souldiers. This news coming to <hi>Carthage,</hi> cauſed a publick mourning, which they were uſed to expreſs by hanging their City walls with blacks.</p>
               <p>The remains of this ſhipwreckt Fleet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out the Storm, and with much difficulty got into <hi>Sicily:</hi> where <hi>Amilcar</hi> by his good conduct and dexterous management did in ſome ſort correct the malignity of their fortune: for comforting and chearing up their ſpirits that had eſcaped the wreck, he takes into pay all the mercenary ſouldiers that he could meet with in the Iſland, then out of every City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Dominion he collects the choiceſt youth; all which he joins with thoſe forces of his City that were there before incamped, and inlarges their camp in the ſame place, having provided all other things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the War. By this his exceeding dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the fame of a fortunate and ſtout Commander, he ſoon raiſed the hopes of his Confederates, ſtruck a terrour into his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and inſpired courage into his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which now conſiſted of forty thouſand foot, and five thouſand horſe, ſo that <hi>Carthage</hi> was ſcarce ſenſible of the loſs at Sea. <hi>So brave<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99302:68"/>Commanders do by wiſe counſels, as by reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, heal the wounds which their Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Fortune.</hi> And Heaven ſeemed by the Storm to have onely preſented to <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> an opportunity to Glory, that his great Vertues might appear in adverſe accidents.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Agathocles</hi> was not ſo much troubled at theſe great preparations of the Enemy, though they did far exceed his forces, as at the conſcience of his own Perfidiouſneſs, which examples he feared would provoke an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation in his own Vaſſals. For he ſuſpected the revolt of moſt of the Towns he had gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd, that they being ſecured to him by no ſtronger a bond of ſubjection then a Fear of his Cruelty, which is but an ill miſtreſs of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, would ſoon ſurrender themſelves up to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that the injured Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would embrace this opportunity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and combine with the Enemy. His greateſt ſollicitude was to ſecure <hi>Gela,</hi> of which he was moſt jealous, and which was likelieſt to give the firſt Example of a Revolt, and might moſt ſecurely doe it, the <hi>Africans</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped within their Territories: and the loſs of twenty of his Ships together with all their lading, being taken by the Enemy in that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, increaſed his fears, and made him more ſollicitous to ſecure that City by a Garriſon. This he did not dare openly to attempt, leſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99302:69"/>the <hi>Geloans,</hi> who watched an opportunity to honeſt their Revolt, ſhould take this advantage of delivering themſelves up to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> which would be of great loſs to him, and emolument to his Enemies. He therefore attempts them by Stratageme. Some of his moſt daring Souldiers he habits as Peaſants and Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that ſeemed to mind no buſineſs leſs then a ſurprize: theſe he ſends into the Town by ſeveral waies and ſmall companies, with their arms concealed, as coming to traffick, and continues the ſupply of them, till he conceived them equal to the Cities ſtrength, and able to ſecure the gates for his entrance. After them he follows with his whole Army, and entring without any reſiſtance, he preſently ſummons the people, and in a fierce and ſhort ſpeech charges them
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>of contracting with the Old Enemy, for the ſlavery of all the good people of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </q> Then, not to give them time to prove their Innocence, (for it was not their Faith he deſired, but their Mony and their Town) he immediately gives order to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſlay the wealthieſt <hi>Geloans,</hi> which were above four thouſand, and makes a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whoſoever had Mony or Plate, and did not immediately bring it forth to him, ſhould ſuffer the tortures that were due to the Betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Country. This Slaughter and Terrours furniſh'd the Tyrant with a vaſt ſum of Mony, but a greater Hatred: for though <pb n="101" facs="tcp:99302:69"/>by theſe waies he terrified all his Vaſſals, yet this was but a weak ſecurity for their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the
<hi>Sicilians</hi> being rather overcome then ſubdued; <hi>and it is eaſier to make Subjects then to keep them. Men may ſubmit to the force of arms, but they will never obey but a juſt power. Agathocles</hi> himſelf alſo did doubt the effects of this Cruelty; therefore that the number of the ſlain might not be known, he buries the dead bodies in the Town-ditch.</p>
               <p>Leaving a Garriſon in <hi>Gela,</hi> he marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, who had incamped on the Hill <hi>Ecnome,</hi> or the <hi>wicked hill:</hi> for the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Phalaris</hi> having formerly there kept his Engine of Torment, the Brazen Bull, he had made the place infamous by his Cruelty; which did now ſeem to expiate the ignominy, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ground to thoſe that were ready to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a bloodier Villain then he that firſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured it. Over againſt them on another hill, that had alſo been a fortification of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> did <hi>Agathocles</hi> pitch his Tent. Betwixt both Armies ran the River <hi>Himera,</hi> which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed for their defence, while they forbore fighting, which was for ſome time, becauſe the place had ſtruck a terrour into both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for at that time there was a tradition of an ancient Prophecy, that <hi>in that place there ſhould fall a great number of men in battel:</hi> and the Prediction not being ſo clear as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99302:70"/>on which ſide the loſs ſhould be, both Armies were ſuſpicious of their fortune, and not daring in a full body to paſs the River, their Superſtition and fear kept them from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging.</p>
               <p>At length this accident drew them forth. The <hi>Libyans</hi> (whoſe Valour is wholly out of themſelves, and their confidence in the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their horſes) did uſually paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forage in the Enemies quarters. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles</hi> not to lie idle, nor betray any fear by his quietneſs, was tempted to the like, and therefore ſends a party upon the ſame deſign into the <hi>Punick</hi> quarters: theſe having done their buſineſs, returning heavy with booty, a party of the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> iſſued out of their Trenches to recover the ſpoil. This the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſan</hi> had foreſeen, and therefore had laid an Ambuſh near the River, who, when the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> were eager in the purſuit, and had incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately paſſed the River, ſuddenly aſſaulted them, and chaſed them back to their own Trenches.
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> who had ſeen all the action, grew inſolent with the ſucceſs of his Stratageme, and thought that now Victory courted him; and intending to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this diſorder of the Enemy, drew forth his whole Army to aſſault them within their Fortifications. Which being done with extraordinary ſpeed, they had filled up the<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99302:70"/>ditches, broke down the Trenches, and entred the Camp, before the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> that were ſurprized could range themſelves in order for defence. But confuſedly (as it is uſual in ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den aſſaults) diſpoſing themſelves in that place and Order which Fortune and their Courage did preſent, they ſtoutly endeavoured to avoid the ignominy of being beaten within their own defences. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> as eagerly followed their advantages, quickned with the hope of ending the War with this one Conflict; ſo that their courage and number ſtill increaſed within the Camp; and the <hi>Africans</hi> hindred by their own diſorders loſing ground, they were not far from Victory, until <hi>Amilcar</hi> ranged and in good order oppoſed to them the Mercenaries of the <hi>Balearick</hi> Iſlands, who ſlinging ſtones of above the weight of a <hi>Mina,</hi> and being exact at the ſcope which they intend, (it being their onely weapon, and their continual practice from their infancy) poured ſuch a ſhowre of ſtones upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that forced them to quit their ground and forſake the Trenches. <hi>Agathocles</hi> notwithſtanding deſpaired not of ſucceſs, but in another quarter aſſaults the Camp: and when he had filled up the ditches, and was almoſt maſter of the trenches, behold another party of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that were but juſt then landed, as they drew near to the Camp, hearing the ſhouts and noiſe of them that were fighting, made haſt, and ſet upon<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99302:71"/>the Enemies in the back; ſo ſtriking a terrour greater then their ſtrength upon the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who were yet ſtoutly oppoſed in the Front, that they believed that they were aſſailed by a bigger Army then they did aſſault, and therefore ſought for ſafety by flight, as deſpairing of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over ſo numerous an Enemy. Some ran towards their Camp, who being purſued by the <hi>Africans,</hi> ſtrewed all the way with their dead bodies. Others fled by the banks of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> and met with as certain a death as that they feared from the ſword of their Enemies: for thirſty through rage and toil of the Battel, which happened to be at noon in the Dog-daies, they drank ſo greedily of the brackiſh water, that they immediately fell down dead; &amp; they were not fewer who were found dead without any wounds all along the banks of the River, then thoſe that were wounded and ſlain in the rout, <hi>Agathocles</hi> having loſt above ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> but five hundred. Thus Providence did as it were ſtrive by re-ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſtrokes to curb the preſent inſolence of this inhumane Tyrant. Firſt, by ſnatching the Victory almoſt out of his poſſeſſion, in ſuch a juncture bringing an unexpected force, that did both confound his orders and break his vigour: upon ſuch uncertain moments does the fortune of Battels and the fate of Kingdomes depend. And ſecondly, he did increaſe the loſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the hopes of a ſecond attempt, by cutting<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99302:71"/>off thoſe whoſe unwounded bodies might have renewed the fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> himſelf, reſerved for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger plague to mankind, eſcaped to his Tents, where gathering up the pieces of his broken Army, he burns his Camp, and haſtens to <hi>Gela,</hi> but cauſed a report to be raiſed that he was fled to <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> this afforded him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſome ſmall Revenge upon three hundred <hi>Africans,</hi> who being informed by the Priſoners that the Tyrant was retreated to
<hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> ſecurely entred into <hi>Gela,</hi> as ſuſpecting no enemy in it; but they found him and their deſtruction there together. He had not ſhut himſelf up there becauſe he could not get to
<hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> but upon deſign to draw the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to beſiege that place, that he might gain time to fortifie and victual
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events of the war. But <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that at firſt had thought to have lain down before <hi>Gela,</hi> hearing it was well mann'd and ſufficiently ſtored to endure a tedious Siege, changed his reſolutions, and applies himſelf to take in thoſe other Towns which now courted him for acceptance. <hi>Camarinae, Leontium, Catana</hi> and
<hi>Tauromenium,</hi> upon the firſt news of the Victory gave themſelves up to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Commands: a few daies after <hi>Meſſene, Abacaenum,</hi> and many other Cities ſubmitted to <hi>Amilcar,</hi> who courteouſly treating all, and<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99302:72"/>impoſing eaſie conditions, made them prefer the <hi>Punick,</hi> a noble, though a forein, bondage, to the ignominious ſervice of an abject Potter: and generally through the whole Iſland the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of <hi>Agathocles</hi> gave a liberty to all to expreſs their hatred of him. For <hi>when people ceaſe to fear thoſe that rule onely by it, they begin to hate them.</hi> And it was not ſo much the loſs of one Battel, as his own Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cruelty, that tore the yoke from the <hi>Sicilians</hi> necks. <hi>Cruel Empires, though they be abſolute, yet are not laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tyrant hearing the daily defection of the Cities, and that his own Wickedneſs and the <hi>Punick</hi> fortune had left him nothing but
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he draws out all his forces from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and with haft retreats thither, leſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others and the Terrour of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might tempt it to the ſame faith. There he emploies the remains of his Army to repair and fortifie the Walls, to fetch as much Proviſion as they could from the adjoining Country, and to fit all things neceſſary for a long Siege. For his bold and reſtleſs ſoul, that knew not how to live unleſs a Tyrant, had revolved all things, and perſwaded to every trial. For
<hi>to men that have loſt their firſt hopes any thing that is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſeem best.</hi> At laſt he projected to transfer the War from the Iſland to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and when he was over-matched with<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99302:72"/>but a part of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> force in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he would dare their whole ſtrength in <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deſign, which on another Enemy had been raſh and dangerous, did now appear ſafe and eaſie. For the long Peace and Proſperity of the <hi>Africans</hi> had ſoftned them to an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of enduring the toils of War; and the too jealous arts of Empire which the
<hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> uſed, (as to diſarm all their Vaſſals, and to embaſe by cruel Oppreſſions their leſs potent Confederates) did aſſure him of but a weak oppoſition, and that by ſuch an unexpected Invaſion he ſhould obtain enough ſpoil to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair all his loſſes at home, and that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of one Battel would force his Enemies to call home their forces to guard their own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Therefore when it was the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that he ſhould ſubmit to the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fate of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> his Mind ſeemed to grow greater by his Miſeries, and that he would ſtill look Fortune in the face.</p>
               <p>To execute this project, he chuſes out ſuch of his Souldiers as he thought fitteſt for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and gave order that the Horſemen ſhould provide themſelves onely of Saddles and Bridles, that when he ſhould get ſome <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> horſe, they might not want neceſſaries to mount them: for although in the late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99302:73"/>the loſs fell moſt upon the Foot, and he had ſaved all his Horſe; yet he wanted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time and Veſſels to tranſport them. Then to prevent any Treachery in his abſence, he made his brother
<hi>Antander</hi> Governour of <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> and to ſecure him from Seditions and Revolts, he divides every Family, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the Fathers, and the Brothers one from another, carrying one part along with him as Hoſtages for their quiet ſubjection that tarried at home: for he conceived that though their Hate were never ſo high againſt him, yet would they forbear any practices, leſt he ſhould revenge their efforts upon thoſe their Friends he had with him. Then to increaſe both his Army and the Garriſon, he manumiſſed all the Slaves, and put them into arms. At home he thought they would be ready to diſcover the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of their Maſters, &amp; ſo they are often made uſe of by Tyrants; abroad they would raiſe an emulation in the free-men to a Military hardineſs and bold attempts. His next care was how to get Mony, and to this he forbore no Wickedneſs that he could imagine profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He ſeizeth upon the Stock and goods of young Orphans, forcing it from their Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, declaring that he was fitter for that truſt then they, and promiſing that when they came of age, he would reſtore all again more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: he forced a Loan from the richeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, deſpoiled the Women of all their gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99302:73"/>Ornaments, and robbed every Temple of the conſecrated Offerings. Then being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the diſcontents of many of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Citizens, who referred all their preſent Troubles and Dangers to his inſatiable appetite of Greatneſs, he calls an aſſembly of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with a countenance compoſed to grief and tears he ſpeaks after this manner to them.</p>

                     <hi>That War is alwaies accounted juſt which is neceſſary, and then Arms are deemed pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when they are the laſt refuge of thoſe that uſe them. This is that which doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the proceedings of this Commonwealth againſt our Old Enemy, the faithleſs and barbarous <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> a people made for the plague of the World, and with whom Peace is more dangerous then War. For their Religion is Cruelty, and by a curſed emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are more bloody then the Gods they worſhip; being inhumane to their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and barbaronſly ingrateful to their moſt faithful Commanders. How miſerable then muſt it needs be to be their Slaves? Theſe, when <hi>Africk</hi> had nothing left but Sands and Deſarts which had not ſubmitted to their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfidious arts, to recreate their wanton thirſt of blood and treaſure, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<hi>Sicily,</hi> pretending no other cauſe of war but our generous love of Liberty, and <pb n="110" facs="tcp:99302:74"/>their boundleſs deſire of Tyranny. To whoſe attempts, had the Gods been pleaſed to favour our juſt arms, we had put an iſſue at the Battel of <hi>Himera,</hi> and forced them to bound their Inſolencies with the Sea. But Fortune, not their Valour, ſnatched the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory frrm us there, and hath now brought them to our Walls: where unleſs we behave our ſelves as perſons worthy of Liberty, we muſt endure the heaviest Slavery, and in chains be the abject ſpectators of the Rapes of our Wives, the Murders of our Children &amp; aged Parents, &amp; ſee them wanton with that Wealth which hath been the price of our ſweat &amp; blood. For how can we expect a tolerable Peace from them, who make War not for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but for Wealth and Luſt? And in vain ſhould we expect Faith from them that are the Examples of Perfidy to the whole world. So that the continuance of the War as well as the beginnings are not matter of our choice, but neceſſity. If any ſhall imprudently condemn us, that we rather provoked then expected the
<hi>Punick</hi> Arms, they are forgetful of the duty of a wiſe Prince, who ought to foreſee dangers, and not decline a preſent Hazard to prevent a future Ruine. Nor can that people eſcape the cenſure of being imprudent, which is ſo in love with a preſent Peace, that they will ſit ſtill, untill their Enemie hath by inſlaving all their leſs potent Neighbours made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <pb n="111" facs="tcp:99302:74"/>too ſtrong for their reſiſtance. Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions therefore that are neceſſary, are not ſubject to blame or praiſe; neither are they to be meaſured by the Event: for many times ſage Counſels want that deſired Succeſs which often attends thoſe that are indiſcreet. And if the approbation of either ſhould depend upon the Iſſue, men would be incouraged to erre, and diſheartned from giving their Country thoſe ſafe advices which are the reſolves of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Since therefore it was neither in our power, nor ſhould it have been our choice, to have avoided the War, and that the Gods would not give Victory as the Merit of our Cauſe; if we will retain our Liberty (which ſhould be more precious then our Lives) there remains nothing now to doe, but ſtoutly to wait for the return of our Fortune, and with patience endure the miſeries of a Siege, which I doubt will be very great: yet I that have learned to be unhappy, can eaſily endure, for it is ſome alleviation of miſery to know the greatneſs of our Misfortune; but my ſpirit is grieved for thoſe of the Good people that muſt be ſhut up with me, and must be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to endure thoſe unaccuſtomed dangers and continual fears. Therefore I require all ſuch as think themſelves unequal to ſo adverſe a fortune, to forſake the Town, and ſecure themſelves and their goods where they can hope for moſt Peace and Safety.</hi>

               <p>This Obſtruction had ſo long delaied <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> that he grew almoſt mad: to get forth he ſaw it was impoſſible, and to ſtand ſtill was dangerous. Therefore when his reſtleſs Mind had preſented many plots, and upon the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of one had ſuggeſted another, and none would attain his end; at length Fortune admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred ſuch an advantage, as his own Reaſon or Power could never have invented or made. For ſome of the Victualling veſſels that had been ſent forth to bring Proviſions to the City were now returning, and being come ſomewhat near the ſhore, were diſcovered by the Enemy, who preſently with their whole Fleet made up to take them, and by this means left the mouth of the Haven open to
<hi>Agathocles;</hi> who not to let ſlip this joyful ſeaſon, with a full ſpred ſail made out to Sea. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that had now almoſt attaqued the Victuallers, ſeeing the <hi>Greeks</hi> coming out with ſo many Ships, at firſt thought they intended the reſcue of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers, and ſo left off the chace of them, and prepared themſelves for fight. But ſeeing they kept a ſtraight courſe, and that they had now gotten ſome diſtance from them, they then ſet themſelves to the purſuit of <hi>Agathocles;</hi> and by this means gave opportunity to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers, being thus ſtrangely delivered, ſafely<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99302:76"/>to unlade at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and to ſtore that City, which already began to ſuffer ſcarcity.

Thus this bold attempt had as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a ſucceſs: and Heaven intending to humble the

Hence it was evident, that though men cannot reſiſt Providence, yet they may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto it, and may weave the webs though they cannot break the threds thereof: therefore they ought never to abandon themſelves, not knowing their end: and though Providence traverſeth unknown waies, yet have they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to follow it, and to hope in whatſoever condition they find themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Sicily,</hi> all the oppoſition of which was carried in thoſe Bottomes. Fear quickned the <hi>Greeks</hi> to avoid moſt bitter Tortures in themſelves, and the Slavery of all that was dear unto them at
<hi>Syracuſe.</hi> Therefore each ſide contended and doubled their diligence, according to their hopes or fears. The <hi>Africans</hi> had the advantage of Oars and Sails; the <hi>Sicilians</hi> in the neareſt diſtance to the ſhore, and the number of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men aboard. The foremoſt of the Tyrant's Veſſels had attained the ſhore, and landed ſome men, when the hindermoſt were attaqued by the Enemy. But many <hi>Greeks</hi> having now a firm footing on land, by their Bows and Slings forced back the <hi>Punick</hi> Fleet, and made them forſake the Veſſels they were almoſt ſeized of, not having an equal number of men; nor could they ſo certainly direct their Arrows out of the Ships, as thoſe that had a ſtable footing.</p>
               <p>The Tyrant being got upon the Continent, preſently lands all his men at a place called the <hi>Quarries,</hi> and having raiſed a ſlight Trench drew all his Ships aground; which with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of boldneſs anſwerable to his deſign he was reſolved to burn.

Beſides, by this means he ſhould neceſſitate his Army to a Victory; for when they had loſt<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99302:78"/>the means and hopes of a Return, they muſt either conquer or periſh. To perform this, he ſaw he muſt proceed by Art, for the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would not eaſily conſent to loſe all hopes of return to their Native ſoil. Therefore he firſt deals with thoſe Captains and Maſters of the Ships he did moſt confide in, and inviting them to a Sacrifice which he made to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> the
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Goddeſſes, he acquaints them, and perſwades them to further his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Then calling the whole Army together, he comes forth amongſt them habited with Prieſtly garments, and a Crown on his head, (which he wore as a Prieſt, for he had not yet aſſumed that enſign of Royalty) he acquaints them with his deſign in coming into <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſpeaks to this purpoſe.</p>

                     <hi>Our happy and ſafe arrival in
<hi>Africk</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make either you or me forget the dangers of
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where we left the good people of that Commonwealth, with all that can make us deſirous of life, and ſweeten our toils for wealth and glory, beſieged by our Old bloody Enemy the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> To deliver them and our ſelves from preſent Ruine there was no way left, but either by unworthy conditions to lengthen out our lives in Slavery, for which we could have no ſecurity from a perfidious Enemy; or to trust to our own ſwords, and by a brave reſiſtance of our adverſe fortune
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99302:79"/>wreſt the Victory from our Conquerours. To execute this Heroick reſolution was not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be pent up in the walls of a Town, for there we muſt have fought with Famine no leſs then with the Enemy, where our wants would have broke our faith: The fears and cries of our Wives and Children would have diſarmed us, and quenched our noble heats for Victory, and importuned us to a preſent, though uncertain, ſecurity with Bondage, rather then to continue the dangers of a Siege for Liberty and Glory. But the ſureſt and eaſieſt way is to transport the War int <hi>Africk,</hi> and carry that flame which would have conſumed us in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> to the gates of <hi>Carthage.</hi> For the advantages in that War which is managed in an Enemies Country are far greater then in that which we are forced to wage at home. In this last we can expect no ſuccours but what that remnant of our waſted Country, which our Enemies will leave unto us, can afford. But abroad you ſhall ſee that the Enemy may be overcome by his own ſtrength, through the revolt of their oppreſſed Vaſſals, the diſcontents of their injured Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, (who are continually panting after a forein hand that may help to break their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yoke.) Beſides, we have to doe with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy whom ſecurity hath made weak, and the deſires of Profit and Pleaſure have drawn away from all defences: For their Towns and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99302:79"/>Cities have not the fortifications of Art or Nature, neither incompaſſed with Walls, nor built on Hills; but ſeated in pleaſant fields and champian countries, hedged about with vineyards and retirements of Pleaſure, which will rather invite then keep off an Enemy. So that your very ſight will make them ſenſible of their weakneſs, and the fear of us will perſwade their ſoftned ſpirits to a ſubjection and compliance with us to the ruine of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> which ſhall feel the War to burn hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here then that ſhe hath kindled in <hi>Sicily,</hi> while every hand conſpires to root up that proud City, that hath hitherto born up her Tyranny by an empty name of Greatneſs, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of her abject Slaves, then by real Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or ſolid Strength. Thus ſhall we gather up that force which we brought not with us. Beſides, the ſuddenneſs of her Terrours and the bravery of our Courage will facilitate and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain our Victory, when ſhe ſhall tremble at the invaſion of that Enemy whom ſhe deſpiſed and reputed her Slaves: and ſhe will grow ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, when the flames of her Villages, Caſtles and pertinacious Towns ſhall give them light to ſee, that Deſtruction hath as eaſie an acceſs to them as they have made for it to others. This is the art not onely to pull down the
<hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> greatneſs, but alſo to put an end to the miſeries of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> where the Enemy will no longer ſtay to overthrow her Liberty, but <pb n="122" facs="tcp:99302:80"/>haſten to prevent their own Slavery. And as we cannot defire an eaſier War, ſo we cannot hope for richer booties; for in the ſacking of <hi>Carthage</hi> we ſhall plunder all the wealth of
<hi>Africk,</hi> and recover all the ſpoils that they have ſtoln from
<hi>Sicily.</hi> Nor will our Glory be leſs then our Profits, whenas all ſucceeding Ages ſhall be taught by the preſent, that we were the firſt that invented and bravely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the Heroick Art of transferring that War to our Enemies doors, which we were not able to endure at home; that chaſed our Conquerours, and beſieged our Beſiegers: ſo that we ſhall ſtill live in their imitation. To expedite this eaſie War, to gather theſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Treaſures, and to raiſe up ſuch a laſting monument for our Fame, the Gods require no more then bold hopes for our ſelves, and juſt Piety towards them. For they have aſſured me of Victory and Succeſſe in the whole War, not onely by auſpicious ſigns in the Sacrifices, but alſo in hearing my Prayers, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Vows, which I made to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina</hi> the Patroneſſes of our beloved Iſland, that if they ſhould ſafely conduct you to the ſhores of <hi>Africk,</hi> I would burn all my Ships as an offering to them. Therefore ſince they have made ſo full a return to my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and have ſo carefully preſerved you to the acquiſition of Wealth and Glory, it is fit that I do not provoke their anger to blast this<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99302:80"/>enterprize by a ſacrilegious neglect of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions Vows.</hi>

               <p>When he had ſaid thus, one of his Servants puts into his hand a lighted Torch, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the like to be delivered to all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains: then invoking <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> he ſet fire to the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Ship, and all the Officers did the like to theirs; and when the flame had kindled upon the Ships, he orders the Trumpets to ſound a charge, and the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my gave a ſhout, &amp; every one praied for an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py return home. But this ſudden joy was violent &amp; ſhort, too like the flame with which it began and waſted. For the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> though at firſt they were bewitched with the ſpeech, and chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Arts of the Tyrant, who had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Religion which was but his Neceſſity and Deſign, neither giving time to conſult, nor expecting their conſent; yet at laſt, when they turned their eyes from the periſhing flames, and look'd upon the Sea, they began to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their thoughts the vaſt diſtance betwixt them and home; they compared the mercileſs waves with the dangers on the land, where ſo ſmall a number were to be expoſed to the fury of a mighty Commonwealth: the memory of the Battel of <hi>Himera,</hi> and the late terrours of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet grew freſh, and appal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all thoſe ſanguine hopes their falſe Leader had ſuggeſted: and when they reflected again<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99302:81"/>upon the aſhes of their burnt Ships, and ſaw all the means of a Return cut off, they curſed their cruel deſtinies, and their Joy (as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with all ſudden Paſſions) expired into Deſpair and Madneſs, and had any one dared to begin, they were all diſpoſed to mutiny.
<hi>Agathocles</hi> perceived the change, and feared the effects; and therefore to give vent to that dark and melancholy humour, which like a diſmal cloud threatned a Tempeſt, he led them out to invade the <hi>African</hi> Empire, that it might ſpend all its fury upon the Enemy, and not be troubleſome to their Commander. So deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt attempt againſt
<hi>Megalopolis,</hi> he leads them thither with a moderate march: not too ſlow, leſt he ſhould confeſs a fear by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies; nor too haſty, both that he might give leave to Fame to render him ſtronger then he was, (For
<hi>diſtant terrours are alwaies believed greater then they are; and when the truth cannot be diſcovered, Fear doth conjecture many falſe dangers)</hi> as alſo that he might permit his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to take a full proſpect of the Country, which through their whole march appeared ſo delightful and rich, that it did rather refreſh then weary their drooping ſpirits. For the whole Country abounded with Vineyards, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards of all kind of Fruits, Gardens and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Pleaſure. The Fields and manured grounds ſeemed to labour under the burden of the crop, the Paſtures with variety of Cattel
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99302:81"/>boaſted the riches of the owners; every piece of ground was exactly watered with Rivers and Aqueducts, adorned with ſtately and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent houſes, which bragged of as much Riches within as there was plenty without. This being the Country whither the wealthier
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> made their diverſions, when they were wearied with the tumult and buſineſs of the City. The happineſs of the ſoil ſoon raiſed the hopes of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> when they ſaw there were equal rewards for their labours, and large booties for their Victories. Then all began to praiſe and commend the prudence of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and duty with the love of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience returned to every breaſt. <hi>So unſteady are the motions of Vulgar ſouls, whoſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations being faſtned to the preſent objects, vary according to their appearances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> makes uſe of this preſent temper, and therefore giveth a ſudden ſtorm to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which through long Peace had outlived the knowledge of an Enemy and all experience of War, and at this time thought of nothing leſs then an Invaſion, and ſo was ſoon maſter'd by the deſperate <hi>Greeks;</hi> to whom their Leader gave the plunder of the Town, that ſo he might raiſe their Courage, and feed their hopes by the booty. From thence he marches to a City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>White Tunis,</hi> which was about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and makes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99302:82"/>it fall under the ſame fate as the other did; they being alſo circumvented by the ſecurity of Peace, and miſchiefs of War. The Army being now inriched by the ſpoils of theſe two Cities, would have them garriſon'd as places to depoſite their pillage. <hi>Agathocles</hi> (that knew how deſtructive this would be to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and that the more hopes they had of a refuge, they would have the leſs courage to fight) tells them,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>that the booty which they had as yet got, was but poor and contemptible to thoſe vaſt treaſures one Victory over the Enemy would afford; and that until that were paſt no place could be ſecure, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every Village would be a ſafe depoſitory to the conquerour.</hi>
                  </q> And urging this with ſuch authority as his ſucceſs had now heightned, he cauſes them to demoliſh thoſe two Towns, and incamps in the field, leſt the retirements of the City ſhould ſoften them by Luxury before the encounter which he expected from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, that rode about the ſhore to wait the iſſue of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> landing, when they had ſeen them burn their Ships, did at firſt triumph, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that their fears had driven them to ſuch deſperate counſels: but when they ſaw them draw off from the ſhore, and march up into the neighbouring country, they then conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99302:82"/>at their deſign, and judged that the flames of thoſe ſhips would kindle a fire in their Commonwealth, and therefore wiſh'd they could have quench'd them with the
<hi>Sicilian</hi> blood or their own tears. Thus expreſſing their fears and ſorrows with great lamentations, and hanging the prowes of their Gallies with skins, (which was the ceremony of ſadneſs when any great misfortune befell their City) they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the brazen beaks of the burnt ſhips, and ſent them with the Intelligence of what had happened to the Senate. But before this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice came, <hi>Carthage</hi> was alarmed by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted Peaſants and Fugitives of the ſacked Towns, who fled thither for ſuccour and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the deſtructive <hi>Greeks;</hi> and, as it is uſual, they had magnified every thing to the greateſt terrour. The whole City was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with this unexpected Invaſion, and could not reconcile this ſadder news with the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their late Victory at <hi>Himera,</hi> but by ſuppoſing their condition worſe, and that by the fortune of a ſecond Battel they had loſt all their forces both by Sea and Land. For otherwiſe they conceived <hi>Agathocles</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have dared to aſſail his Conquerours at their own gates; or could have been ſo raſhly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as for ſome haſty ſpoils of <hi>Africk,</hi> to have left
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> a prey to the beſiegers; nor could he have paſſed the Sea, had his enemies Fleet been yet unattempted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99302:83"/>Theſe ſad apprehenſions filled all minds with horrour and confuſion. The Senate with fear and haſt was gathered into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and the people with hideous clamours flocking about them, requiring them maturely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the ſafety of their Republick, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med now upon the Verge of Ruine. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of fear in every Order made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue their own ſtrength; and the greater diligence and the more arts every one uſed to conceal it, made them appear more evidently fearful. They diſcourſed how that they had no Army of Mercenaries ready to oppoſe the Enemy; their Nobleſs was ſluggiſh, luxurious, and by a long Peace ſoftned to effeminacy; their more hopeful Youth were either loſt in the Shipwreck, or emploied in the Iſland; the Populacy were wholly ignorant of arms, and now ſo terrified, that they would never dare to fleſh themſelves on an experienced Enemy, hardned with former perils, heightned with ſpoils, and, as they ſuſpected, with a mighty Victory. Therefore in this doubtful ſtate of affairs, ſome were of advice to ſend Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to treat with <hi>Agathocles</hi> concerning Peace, and by that advantage to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fully of their Enemies ſtrength: Others were of opinion that they ſhould defer any ſuch Treaty, till they were acquainted with the ſtate of their own Army, and ſo to manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accordingly. But while they were diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99302:83"/>with theſe different counſels, the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Admiral arrive at the Haven; who giving them a particular account of what had happened, and ſhewing them the beaks of their Enemies Ships, did allay their fears, but heightned their indignation againſt their Sea-Officers, that through baſeneſs or folly had ſuffered a baffled Enemy to invade <hi>Africk;</hi> and venting their fury in a cenſure of them, with more calm ſpirits they fall to conſult of fitting Remedies for the preſent Miſchief.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of their own and <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s condition made them deſpiſe their half-conquered Enemy; therefore ſcorning to treat with him of Peace, they reſolved upon the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the War. To this end, as more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Liberty then doubtful of Victory, (which is ſeldome obtained by divided Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) they appoint two Generals,
<hi>Bomilcar</hi> and <hi>Hanno;</hi> Perſons of different tempers and oppoſite Factions. The firſt cruel, faithleſs, ambitious and impatient of equality: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more deſirous of Glory then Power; of a civil Modeſty, fierce againſt an Enemy, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his own Citizens. <hi>Bomilcar</hi> was choſen, becauſe his Greatneſs made it dangerous to paſs him by in ſo honourable an emploiment; but <hi>Hanno,</hi> to watch over the others actions, which not onely the love of his Country, but alſo an ancient fewd betwixt their Families, did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99302:84"/>them would be with the moſt exact circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. His Integrity they hoped would ſo temper his Paſſions, that he would not to his private Diſcords ſacrifice the Publick Safety in the male-adminiſtration of his charge; and his hate of
<hi>Bomilcar</hi> promiſed a ſufficient ballance to his aſpiring ſoul, who was ſuſpected to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Tyranny, but as yet wanted an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſatisfie his Ambition. Therefore they durſt not truſt him alone with ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power, as they muſt expect onely from his Modeſty when he would lay it down.</p>
               <p>A Vertue ſometimes wanting in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Nobleſs, who often attempted upon the Liberty of their Commonwealth. Which ſome refer to the vitious conſtitution of their Government, that preferr'd ſuch to the higheſt truſt whoſe cenſe was largeſt, and ſo made Wealth, not Vertue, the mark for Honour. For they thought the greatneſs of their intereſt in their Country would oblige them to a greater induſtry for its preſervation. This indeed is a remedy proper againſt a forein yoke, but an incitement to domeſtick Tyranny. For ſuch, as they will be watchful guardians to preſerve their City from others, ſo will they often make attempts upon it themſelves. And <hi>thoſe that abound with Wealth, when they ſee Glory and Power are the attendants of it, grow inſolent, and eſteem the Supreme power but their due:<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99302:84"/>Equality of Honour being not competent with the inequality of Fortune.</hi> It was accounted the great preſervative of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, that Riches came into no conſideration when they came to chuſe the Commanders of their Forces, but they would fetch their Dictators from the plough, and nominate thoſe for Conſuls whoſe eſtates were ſo ſcanty, that the publick ſtock muſt defray the charges of their Funerals, and provide portions for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Daughters. Theſe men after they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the publick charge, and eminently ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Commonwealth, haſted home to look after their narrow fortunes and their few acres; when they had yoked the Enemy, returned to doe the like to their Oxen, and to finiſh the Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage they had begun; and ſo became private perſons, and were obedient to the ordinary Magiſtrates, contented with their turnips, and deſiring no more of the ſpoil of the conquered then a wooden goblet to uſe in Sacrifices. So that they gave not the leaſt jealouſie of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the people, who ſtill making their choice by the Merit of the perſons, had ſo many
<hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi</hi> among them, men glorious with ſeveral Victories, that they were a guard for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick againſt each other. Thus ſpoiling Riches of that glory which is given to it in a corrupt State, they preſerved their own Liberty and the <hi>Patrician</hi> Modeſty, till the love of Wealth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; and then followed the deſire of Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:99302:85"/>Others referred this to the baſe Ingratitude of the People, which is the uſual diſeaſe of all Democracies, who rewarded their victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commanders with ſeditious Accuſations, and afterwards with the Croſs, and often did too ſeverely puniſh the miſchances of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous. So that many that had the chief Command of their forces, have prevented their unjuſt ſentences with a voluntary renunciation of life and emploiment; or to defend their Dignity, ſought to extinguiſh thoſe flames which would have conſumed their private houſes, with the ruine of the Publick, and pulling down the frame of Government. So that this Ingratitude and Severity did diminiſh the infamy, and ſomewhat neceſſitate ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. But this infirmity never fell upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; for while it was not corrupted by too great an Empire, they were far from ſuch unworthy Jealouſies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the proſperous Valour of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with ſuch glorious Triumphs as did both ſatiate their thirſts of honour, and not force them to ſeek the ſhadow of a name by being great Oppreſſors; and alſo raiſed the hopes and ſpirits of their other Citizens to the like atchievements. Which did both increaſe their Strength and Empire, and alſo ſecure their Liberty by ſo many rivals of glory. If ever they puniſhed the unſucceſsful, it was with much humanity. Such as loſt their Armies by<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99302:85"/>any criminal failance, had the light correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a pecuniary mulct, and were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to waſh away the ignominy of an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw with their own blood. Such as through Misfortune, Inadvertency, or Ignorance brought wounds upon the Commonwealth, were rather careſſed and cheared, then dealt ſeverely with; and had ſometimes their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges renewed, that they might redeem the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they had before loſt. He that by a raſh and indiſcreet deſire of Victory, had occaſioned that terrible Overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, in ſtead of a triumph, had the Conſuls and the whole Senate met him; who though they could not congratulate his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did yet thank him for his valour, that he had not deſpaired of the Commonwealth. This proceeding of theirs towards their Generals was upon a good conſideration: Becauſe they judged it to be a matter of great importance, that ſuch as were intruſted with affairs of ſo great moment as managing a Battel, ſhould, when they were to make their reſolutions, have their minds free, and without ſollicitude of their Cities cenſure of their actions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would not increaſe their difficulties; ſuppoſing that none could be gallant under the load of ſo many doubts and fears. And as
<hi>Carthage</hi> wanted this Wiſdome of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo did ſhe the Glory and Power, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forced to ſerve her rival of Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:99302:86"/>The Generals being choſen, they conceived too great dangers in the leaſt delay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made too much haſt: for they tarried not to levy ſouldiers from the Confederate Cities, nor to take up ſuch that were hardned with the country labours; but took thoſe of their own City, whom the pleaſures and abject arts of the City had made unfit for the toils of war; ſuch alſo whom the fortune of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and the news of the late Victory in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> had raiſed to ſo high a confidence, that they conceived it rather a journy to fetch in Slaves, then an encounter to conquer an Enemy: therefore adviſing one another to give quarter to as many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> as were not obſtinate to ruine, they carried along with them twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand pair of fetters to bind their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives. And they ſeemed to be careful of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then leſt their delaies would give opportunity to the Enemy to get away out of <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſo defeat their hopes of ſpoil. By this great confidence in themſelves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the enemy, <hi>(in whom nothing can be ſafely despiſed; for a neglectful contempt will alwaies make him ſtronger)</hi> they were preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated to an Overthrow. For they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew out into the Field, being about forty thouſand Foot, one thouſand Horſe, and two thouſand Chariots; and pitching upon an Hill not far from the Enemy, they ranged all their Forces for a Battel. <hi>Hanno</hi> commanded the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99302:86"/>right Wing, and with him was the <hi>Sacred Band</hi> of
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the Chariots and Horſe being placed in the Front; and
<hi>Bomil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> commanded the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> was glad the Enemy was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ingage, and that their Confidence made them neglect thoſe ſafe counſels, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his deſperate Army to ſpend it ſelf in its own fury, and waſte by delaies; therefore declines not the fight, but uſes his greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in his preparations and orders of this Battel, upon which depended the fortune of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> and all his hopes: knowing that <hi>Fear and Confidence have their birth in the firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents;</hi> and that by the iſſue of this firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter he ſhould adminiſter to Fame, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupate the minds of men in concluding the fortune of the whole War. He orders his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel according to the manner of the Enemy. For having learned the temper of the two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, (a neceſſary part of the arts of a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of which <hi>Annibal</hi> afterwards made great uſe in his war in
<hi>Italy,</hi> forming his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns according to the humour of him who commanded the Enemies battel) he commits the charge of his right wing to his ſon <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathus,</hi> that was to ingage againſt <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> where an inſolent, treacherous Captain, and diffident Souldiers, promiſed the feweſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and leaſt oppoſition: and he himſelf
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99302:87"/>commands the left, to confront <hi>Hanno,</hi> where were all things that are to be expected in a good Leader and reſolute Souldiers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of his party wanted arms, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them with this invention: he cauſes them to take the coverings of ſhields, and to diſtend them with ſticks and rods, and to ſtuff them out in the form of a ſhield, and gave them to ſuch as wanted, and were in the rear; not as fit for uſe, but to elude the Enemies ſight, who at a diſtance could not judge them other then real ſhields. And leſt his Souldiers ſhould be diſcomfited by that terrible proſpect of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies number and horſe (For <hi>the eyes moſt commonly are the firſt that are overcome in every battel</hi>) he had another invention to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their minds of Victory: for he cauſed many Owles, which he had provided for that purpoſe, to be let flie in ſeveral places of the Camp; which flying round about the Army, and alighting ſometimes upon the helmets, ſometimes upon the ſhields of the Souldiers, was taken for an auſpicious augury, becauſe this kind of bird was conſecrated to <hi>Minerva</hi> a warlike Goddeſs. And withal he cauſes it, as an interpretation of the <hi>Omen,</hi> to be rumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſhe had aſſured him of an happy ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe devices, though they ſeem trifles and empty projects, yet often prove great moments<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99302:87"/>to wonderful ſucceſſes; they raiſing in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of an Army great Confidence, and by that Confidence they overcome. For a Confidence that is derived from the conceived care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Heaven, and to which a Deity gives the firſt Original, is moſt active and vigorous; becauſe a Prediction doth not onely raiſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible hope, and promiſe an aſſiſtance from Heaven, but alſo doth, by thoſe hopes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely admoniſh to brave reſolutions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romans,</hi> who could boaſt of more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories then any other Nation, uſed to raiſe a Confidence in their Forces by the waies of Religion: for they never would create their Conſuls for their Expeditions, levy their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, begin their marches, or join in Battel, without their Auguries and Auſpicies. And without doing ſome ſuch thing never did any of their wiſe and noble Captains attempt any great action; conceiving it difficult to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in it, unleſs their Souldiers did firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the Gods were on their part. And herein doth this Confidence differ from that which ariſeth in an Army from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their own ſtrength, and contempt of the enemy: this commonly is pregnant with neglect of diſcipline, and too much ſecurity; but the former never diſarms it ſelf either by negligence or raſhneſs; for the Commanders, who knew the uncertainty of human affairs, and how much vanity there was in ſuch Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99302:88"/>uſed them onely to heighten the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and themſelves in the mean while were careful of taking every advantage for Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> (that had omitted no part of care; for his Army was ready and prepared either to fight or chaſe, not heavy with luggage, not greedy of ſpoil, intent upon the commands of their Leader, and obſerving his very nods, not anxious for ſafety, nor too preſumptive of Victory) ſoon found the effects of his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have raiſed the confidence of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. For upon the firſt charge they ſtoutly repulſed the <hi>Punick</hi> Chariots upon their own Foot, and bravely receiving their Horſe forced them to flight: and when <hi>Hanno</hi> had brought up his Foot, doing all that the Love of his Country and Glory exacted from him (for he thought to have gotten the Victory by his alone Wing) with many wounds they ſlew him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſooner forſaken by Fortune then Valour: and with him fell the courage of the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which were put to flight; onely the <hi>Sacred Band</hi> did for a while ſtoutly endeavour to make good the retreat. In the other wing <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> did but faintly aſſault the Enemy, and ſcarce ſtood upon his own defence, not ſeeking the Victory, but the Empire of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which he conceived their overthrow would facilitate, and their low condition impoſe on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and then he doubted not with eaſe to<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99302:88"/>ſend the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> out of <hi>Africk.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſoon as he heard of <hi>Hanno</hi>'s death, he divulges it among his own party, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to retreat to a neighbouring Hill: which being very diſorderly performed, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Band</hi> being now no longer able to ſuſtain the victorious <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were at laſt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed, every one running the next way to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and caſting away their arms which they had taken for their defence, as if they feared their own aſſiſtances.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sicilians</hi> purſued them not far, but gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily returned to the rifling of the Camp; where among the other ſpoils, they found the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations not for War, but for Victory, thoſe Fetters which had been provided for their Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. This increaſed the hatred of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and heightned the joy of the Victory, by the proſpect of the dangers they had eſcaped. For <hi>although we rather wiſh an uninterrupted flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing fortune; yet ſuch doth not affect us with ſo high a ſenſe of pleaſure, as that which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence raiſes us unto from the utmost dangers.</hi> This likewiſe adminiſtred occaſion of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and wondering at the Juſtice of that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power of the World, that had thus ſhewed the vanity of humane power and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and bound the proud
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> in thoſe fetters which they had provided for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Enemy. As alſo <hi>how quick the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99302:89"/>of Proſperity may be after the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate miſery. That there is no condition ſo low, but may have hopes, nor any ſo high that is without the reach of fears.</hi> The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant while his forces were intire in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> was overthrown by the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> yet with the remains of that Army he beats his Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Two emulous Cities,
<hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> both at one time Conquerours and conquered, ſtreightned and beſieged by their mutual forces. The loſs of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in this Battel was very great, but uncertain: for ſome ſay it was but one thouſand, others relate three, and others ſix thouſand. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> bought this great Victory with but little blood, for he loſt at moſt but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and others ſay but two.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> amazed at this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed overthrow by ſo weak an Enemy, referred their misfortune to the anger of their neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods. They conceived <hi>Hercules</hi> the Patron of their City to be offended with them, becauſe they had long diſuſed to ſend the Tenths of all their Revenues to that God at <hi>Tyre,</hi> from whence they were extracted, which they had moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved at the firſt Plantation of their Colony. But when their State was increaſed by a continued Proſperity, and their Riches grown to a vaſt height, their Covetouſneſs alſo inlarging with their Wealth, they envied their<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99302:89"/>Gods ſo great a ſumme as their Tenths did then amount unto, and therefore ſent little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: either thinking their Gods would be pleaſed with the parſimony of their Idolaters, and not delighted in an un-emploied Treaſure; or elſe that by their preſent Felicity they were now able to ſtand by themſelves without the care of their Gods. Such is the common weakneſs of humane minds, as to think the preſent fortune puts them out of a dependance on Heaven; and ſo great their Ingratitude, that proud with their happineſs, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves the authours of their own fortunes, and neglect the teſtimonies of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging from whoſe bounty they derived their Bleſſings. And being thus inſolent towards their Gods, they grow injurious to men, and ſo open all the Avenues to deſtruction. This
<hi>Saluſt</hi> obſerves of his <hi>Romans,</hi> who in their firſt beginnings were Magnificent in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, Parſimonious in their Families, and Faithful to their Friends: but when their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs feared no rival, and their fortune had left no Enemy, firſt the love of Riches, then Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Command taught them to neglect their Gods, and be perfidious to men, deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Religion, corrupted their Converſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched their Diſcipline, and at laſt overthrew their Commonwealth. For <hi>Religion being the Reverence of a Deity, which is ſuppoſed able to reward and puniſh according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99302:90"/>of the Worſhippers, is productive of good Orders. Theſe cement the minds of men, and lay the obligations of a ſolid faith, which fits them for great actions, by a mutual confidence, which ſeldome fails of good ſucceſs.</hi> But where Religion is contemned, there the people are not far from ruine, or ſome heavy ſcourge; for that being the foundation of Society, when it is once ſhaken by contempt, the whole fabrick cannot be ſtable nor laſting.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Religious rites that are worn out by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, when ſecurity makes men more deſirous of pleaſures then careful of Religion, are reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Adverſity. And Fear, though it does not (as the Atheiſts ſay) make Gods, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives their worſhip.</hi> For theſe
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> awakened with the clamours of their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſent a great ſumme of mony with other moſt precious offerings to
<hi>Hercules,</hi> and Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Shrines for all their other Gods at
<hi>Tyre,</hi> thinking to buy off their fury, and corrupt their Juſtice. And neglecting no part of their barbarous Superſtition, they endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile their <hi>Saturn</hi> alſo, whom they conceived peeviſh likewiſe. For whereas of old they were uſed to ſacrifice to him their moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and hopeful Children, nobly or honeſtly born, they had of late put him off with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſuppoſititious births. Therefore by a curſed Superſtition which extinguiſhed huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>(ſuch is the fury of a devilliſh Worſhip,<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99302:90"/>that when it is moſt exact it increaſes their Crimes)</hi> they choſe two hundred Children of their moſt eminent Nobleſs for a publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Beſides many others that lay under ſome misfortune, or were affraid of ſome great accuſations, offered their blood for their Cities ſafety, which were no leſs then three hundred. All theſe were conſumed in a Sacrifice. For being bound and laid upon the arms of their Idol, which was a great Image of braſs with his hands ſtretch'd downwards to the earth, the unhappy wretches rowled off, and fell into a furnace of fire that was underneath. This cruel Superſtition the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> had brought from <hi>Tyre,</hi> from whence the
<hi>Jews</hi> alſo derived their worſhip of <hi>Moloch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though they were thus buſie in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, yet were they not negligent in their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular proviſions: for they ſent to
<hi>Amilcar</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that he ſhould ſpeedily ſend them what forces he could ſpare; and withal they ſent to him by the ſame Meſſengers the brazen beaks of <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s Ships, which their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral had brought to <hi>Carthage,</hi> with inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how he ſhould uſe them. <hi>Amilcar</hi> having received the news, commands the Meſſengers to ſuppreſs the misfortunes of their City, and to divulge in his own Army that <hi>Agathocles</hi> with his whole party were utterly loſt. And ſome of the ſame men he ſends into <hi>Syracuſe</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99302:91"/>to move them to a ſurrender of the Town, which could not now hope for any ſuccours, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> was totally overthrown, and his Ships taken and burnt at <hi>Carthage;</hi> for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of which they ſhewed the brazen beaks which had his mark upon them, and were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known to be his. The people through the preſent miſeries of the Siege were the more capable of any, though falſe, terrours; and ſuch as deſired a change of the State were moſt greedy after news. Theſe thronging about the <hi>Punick</hi> Meſſengers and place of the Treaty, had got ſome inkling of the news: it was ſoon divulged; for in a publick expectation all were impatient of any great ſecret, and eaſily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And the Commanders in the Town la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to ſuppreſs, did increaſe the fame of it: for all diſcourſes being forbidden were the more multiplied; and thoſe who, if it had been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would have related no more then the truth, becauſe it was not ſafe, did by their ill-ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fears and ſecret whiſperings make more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy things to be conjectured.</p>
               <p>The Governours of the Garriſon ſuſpecting ſome Sedition and Mutinies might be formed by theſe ſad tidings, as ſoon as ever they had diſmiſſed (which was ſpeedily) the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Envoies, forced out of the Town all the unprofitable mouths, and all whom they ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as friends or kindred of the <hi>Banditi,</hi> which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99302:91"/>were about eight thouſand. This filled the whole City with tears and confuſion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houſe had ſomething to bewail, either the ſuppoſed deaths of <hi>Agathocles</hi> and their friends that were with him, or elſe the miſery of thoſe that were now to be driven from their City and houſhold-gods, and expoſed to the cruelty of a beſieging Enemy. Theſe ſad conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions forced many bitter execrations upon am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Tyrants and their hateful miniſters. But
<hi>Amilcar,</hi> that was a Generous Enemy, and had a greater ſenſe of humanity then was in the breaſts of <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s agents, did ſafely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe expulſed wretches to remove from the walls of their unhappy City; but did more ſtrictly beſiege the Town. And ſuppoſing that the want of ſo many, whom they had turned out, had weakned them as to the defence of their works, and that the terrours of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had abated the obſtinacy of the beſieged, he ſent in another ſummons, with a tender of good conditions to <hi>Antander</hi> and the Officers of the Garriſon, if they would quickly ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Antander,</hi> that was a Coward, and had all his Brothers Vices, but none of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, was for the delivery of the Town, and covered the baſeneſs of his ſpirit with the honeſt name of Pity to the people. But <hi>Eurymaon</hi> an
<hi>Aetolian,</hi> whom <hi>Agathocles</hi> had left in Commiſſion with his Brother, was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judgement, and perſwaded all the reſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99302:92"/>to hold out till they might have ſome better Intelligence of the ſtate of the Tyrant. For it was a madneſs to form any counſels upon an information from an Enemy, who for their intereſt will ſuggeſt falſhoods for truth, or at leaſt render things worſe then in truth they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amilcar</hi> underſtanding how his arts had miſcarried, and that the beſieged were ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, prepares all things to ſtorm the Town. But in the mean while there came into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> two Gallies which <hi>Agathocles</hi> had built after his Victory, and mann'd with the ſtouteſt and moſt expert Sailors, under the command of <hi>Nearchus,</hi> one of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, to carry the news of his ſucceſs to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi> Theſe having a lucky ſail, came the fifth day in the evening near to <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> and at break of day the next morning, crowned with garlands, ſinging, and wanton with all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of joy, they made towards the City. The <hi>Punick</hi> Fleet which lay in the mouth of the Haven, upon the firſt diſcovery ſent out ſome Veſſels to take them; where the flight of the one and the purſuit of the other party made ſo rare and ſtrong a conteſt, that it called both the beſiegers and beſieged to be ſpectators; each with praiers and wiſhes favouring his own party, and by a viciſſitude of geſtures expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their hopes and fears, terrifying and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging,<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99302:92"/>as they imagined cauſe. Each party did their utmoſt, and the Gallies were then touching the ſhore, when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had laid hold on them; and had then carried them away, had not the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> that ſtood on the ſhore, with their darts, weapons and ſtones forced them back, and made them leave the jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meſſengers to tell their lucky news. <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> ſuppoſing that ſeaſon convenient for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, when the ſight at Sea and great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had diverted their minds, and drew many of their ſouldiers off from their guard, did immediately clap his Ladders to the Walls, and had juſt then poſſeſſed them, when diſcovered by ſome of the Watch that were going about to ſettle the Guards, they were ſtoutly incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and the alarm being given to the whole City, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> were beaten off, and thoſe killed that had already gotten up. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> vexed by this diſappointment ſlackens the ſiege, and ſent away five thouſand of his Army to the defence of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and permits <hi>Syracuſe</hi> for a time to pleaſe it ſelf with the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news. Where all the diſcourſe now was in extolling the wiſdome of <hi>Agathocles;</hi> and what before ſeemed to be but capricios and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of deſpair, were now by ſucceſs ſo ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they appeared the Counſels of the Gods, the onely ſafe reſolves that could be made, and the Contriver was magnified to the Heavens, that he could doe more in an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99302:93"/>throw then the Enemy in a Victory. <hi>Succeſs is the onely Optick by which the Vulgar ſurvey and judge of Counſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe things were done in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
<hi>Carthage</hi> wearied her adverſe Gods with inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious Sacrifices,
<hi>Agathocles</hi> makes uſe of his Victory, which the <hi>Punick</hi> Pride and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs rendred more advantageous. For that Commonwealth did uſe to treat their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered neighbours as foreiners, and their leſs potent Confederates like Subjects and Vaſſals. Which was contrary to the
<hi>Roman</hi> prudence, who the ſame day had many people both Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Citizens, and made not wars nor ſought conqueſts for Tyranny, but for their mutual ſtrength and common ſafety, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled together by the ſame cuſtomes and affinity, joined alſo their Intereſts with their Wealth, and were concerned in a common fate. Thoſe Cities that obſerved not this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to Greatneſs, their Empires might be large, yet never ſtrong nor laſting, and they periſhed at laſt by their own arts. For <hi>no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is durable which the Sword onely gives: but Benefits have a perpetual obligation.</hi> So was it with <hi>Carthage,</hi> when the fame of their overthrow had filled <hi>Africk</hi> with wonder, how ſo great an Empire could receive ſo mortal and ſudden a blow by a conquered Enemy; and not finding any more obvious ſolution, then that<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99302:93"/>that City's Name was greater then her Power, their admiration turned into a contempt of the conquered, and their former Injuries perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to an obſequiouſneſs to the fortune of the Conquerour. Therefore many Cities did readily confederate with him, and ſent him ſupplies of Proviſion and Mony for his Army. He alſo, to increaſe the terrour, and give new matter to Fame, marches within five miles of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and there pitching his Tents, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtroied by fire and ſword all round about, that they might ſee the burning Villages from the walls of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Then reſolving to take in all the Maritime Towns that yet were tenacious of their faith to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and would not comply with him; he fortifies his Camp about <hi>Tunis,</hi> and marches to <hi>Neapolis,</hi> which he takes by aſſault: but, contrary to his nature, he did temporize with his Fortune, and as the reaſon of War required did uſe them gently. For <hi>the fame of Clemency is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe that deſign the erecting of a new Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next attempt was to beſiege <hi>Adryme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> during which Siege he enters into Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with <hi>Elymas,</hi> one of the
<hi>Libyan</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that had forſook the Friendſhip of declining
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and intended as little faith to his new Aſſociate; who received him, though he knew he brought more name then aſſiſtance, being
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99302:94"/>of no aſſured truſt. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> when they thought the Tyrant ſo far ingaged at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drymetus,</hi> that he could not with honour leave that enterpize, hoped in the mean while to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<hi>Tunis;</hi> and therefore ſending out their Forces, they ſoon maſtered his Camp, which was before the Town, and then applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take the Town it ſelf. <hi>Agathocles</hi> hearing this, after his uſual manner, being ſudden in Counſels and happy in the Events, was reſolved both to continue the ſiege at <hi>Adry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus</hi> and to relieve
<hi>Tunis.</hi> Therefore taking with him a ſmall party, and leaving enough to make good the Siege, with great diligence and ſecrecy he poſſeſies himſelf of an Hill which lay open to the proſpect of the
<hi>Adrymetines,</hi> and alſo to the beſiegers of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and at night cauſed his Souldiers to make many and great fires. By this ſlight Stratageme, which was managed onely by the knowledge of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (a neceſſary part of Military skill) he did deceive his Enemies at both places. For thoſe that lay before <hi>Tunis</hi> thought he came with his whole Army to raiſe the Siege, and therefore they quitted it. And the
<hi>Adrymetines</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they were more Forces gathered to ſtrengthen the Siege, or force the Town, and upon that apprehenſion made an immediate ſurrender upon compoſition. After this he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
<hi>Thapſus,</hi> and takes it by force; and by force, and credit of his former Victories, and<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99302:94"/>his other arts, he got the power of no leſs then two hundred garriſon'd places.</p>
               <p>Having gathered the ſpoils of all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he marches up into the Upper <hi>Libya,</hi> both to increaſe his plunder, and ſtrengthen himſelf with new confederacies. Where when he had continued ſome daies, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the coming of ſome of their forces from
<hi>Sicily,</hi> renew their hopes and deſigns to beſiege <hi>Tunis,</hi> having already recovered many of the neighbouring places that had been taken by the Enemy. But <hi>Agathocles</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Intelligence of it, haſtes back, and when he was not far from the Enemy, incamps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to refeſh his wearied Souldiers a while; but commanding them to make no fires, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches a way by night, and at break of day comes upon the
<hi>Africans</hi> like a clap of thunder, while they were ſecure, diſordered, and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d to forrage. This ſudden appearance fill'd them with an immoderate fear, for they were fitter for a journy then a Battel; and while they haſted to take arms, their very haſt increaſed their fears. In this confuſion he kills two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them, takes no ſmall number, and ſo broke both the Siege and their ſpirits, who had before conceived too highly of their own ſtrength by the acceſs of their Veterane Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from <hi>Sicily.</hi> Heightned with this Succeſs he ſets upon <hi>Elymas</hi> the <hi>Libyan</hi> King his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99302:95"/>who had either broken his League with him, as was not improbable, the <hi>Libyans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unconſtant and barbarous that they did not underſtand Faith or Peace; or elſe the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant feigned that he did ſo, that he might have a pretence for blood and ſpoil, which is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

               <p>But as one blow or favour of Fortune ſeldome comes without another of the ſame kind; ſo the <hi>Sicilian</hi> affairs followed the predominant fortune in <hi>Africk.</hi> For <hi>Amilcar</hi> impatient that
<hi>Syracuſe</hi> alone, which was the onely place there left to the Tyrant, ſhould ſo long ſtop the courſe of his Victories, and hinder him from thoſe Triumphs at home which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved abroad, was too eager to ſnatch at that which in a ſhort time muſt have fallen into his hands. For having a long while by the Fleet at Sea kept all proviſion from the Enemy, and by the Siege waſted all that the neighbouring Country could afford; he might well have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a ſudden ſurrender. But being inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately deſirous of Glory, and deceived by the hopes of a vain Augury, he haſtned his own Ruine, and his Countrie's Danger.

And ſo it fared with <hi>Amilcar.</hi> For the Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of his reſolutions, ſent out in the dark about three thouſand Foot and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe to lie in Ambuſh at a place near <hi>Euryclus,</hi> to diſturb them in their enterprize, and appall them with thoſe terrours which they intended to others. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99302:96"/>thought to ſurprize the Town, came on about midnight to the ſtorm, led on by <hi>Amilcar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his life-guard; and next to him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> that was Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the
<hi>African</hi> Horſe. The Army was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two bodies, one of
<hi>Africans,</hi> the other of the confederate <hi>Greeks:</hi> after theſe followed a mixed multitude without any order or diſcipline, ſuch as were intent upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of the Town, and could be of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the taking of it. Theſe cauſed a great noiſe and buſtle, which are often the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of great Overthrows: and the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo rugged and narrow, thoſe that were to carry the luggage and the ſcaling-ladders began to diſturb one another in the march, and to contend for the way; ſo that forgetful of the Enemy, they went to fighting and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among themſelves; which making a great noiſe and confuſion, gave thoſe in the Ambuſh notice of their Enemies approach. Who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this opportunity, and having the advantage of the upper ground, fiercely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them, and did eaſily increaſe their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, cutting off the way to ſome, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing others to fling themſelves down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices. Every place was filled with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and uncertain clamour, which together with the darkneſs of the night made them conceive the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Ambuſcade to be far greater then it was. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> thus
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99302:96"/>confounded with their own diſorders, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den impreſſion of the Enemy, the ignorance and difficulties of their way, could not tell where to charge, nor whom to fight with, and in this amazement began to flie. Some of them that had not ſpace to uſe their weapons, nor room to flie, were trodden under foot by their own Horſe. Others fell foul upon their own party, the night not diſtinguiſhing betwixt Friend or Foe. Some were broken in pieces upon the rocks, and others were oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the dying carcaſſes of their Friends and their own luggage: ſo that there were various ſeenes of Death, and every ſpecies of Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was there acted. But <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that had a long time with thoſe about him made a ſtout reſiſtance, and in vain, among ſo great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, incited others to the like, was at laſt himſelf taken by the Enemy, and carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into the Town, his whole Army being thus routed and beaten. And
<hi>Amilcar</hi> had been happy howſoever, though in miſery, if he had fallen under the ſame fortune with his Souldiers. But he outlived his Dignity, that with the greater Diſhonour he might periſh in
<hi>Syracuſe.</hi> So uncertain and fallacious are all humane deſigns, that when <hi>Amilcar</hi> thought he was invited by the Gods to compleat the conqueſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and conſummate that Glory to which no
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> had hitherto made ſo near an approach, he ſhould at laſt<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99302:97"/>conclude his Life and Victories in Slavery, and die at the pleaſure of his beſieged Enemies.</p>
               <p>The obſerving <hi>Greeks</hi> had all their wonder raiſed and excuſed in the conſideration of this overthrow. For they could not ſufficiently admire the ſtrange uncertainties of humane Greatneſs, and ſudden changes of conditions. Who may not fear or hope things different from the preſent, and contrary to what are expected, when <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who was a ſtout and ſubtle Commander, and had a very good Army at the Battel of

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:99302:97"/>The <hi>Syracuſans</hi> having gotten this Victory, more by the darkneſs of the night and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the place then by their own Valour, uſed it as barbarouſly as became the ſlaves of an inhumane Tyrant; who beſides the other Miſeries that he brings upon his Vaſſals, doth alſo impreſs his Vices as brands of their Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon their Souls; his power and their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject minds inclining them to the moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flattery of Imitation. For they moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely abuſed their noble Priſoner: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Dignity or Vertues of the Perſon, who through the whole War had done nothing unbecoming a Generous Enemy: they deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the majeſty of his former Command and Succeſs; forgot humane frailty, how ſoon it falls from the greateſt honours to the loweſt miſeries; and, which challenges more pity in humane breaſts, that what by many labours &amp; tedious vertues hath been attained, may be loſt and periſh in one moment. <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> when he had overthrown and taken <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> the great King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> wept over his Priſoner, and gave reverence even to the captived <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and brought his Children to behold the ſpectacle of humane frailty, nor to triumph in it, with this command, that

                  </q> But the ſouls of ſo baſe a Rabble as were the <pb n="158" facs="tcp:99302:98"/>Tyrant's Officers were not capable of ſo vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſiderations, therefore they expoſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> to all the indignities and injuries that an half-ſtarved multitude would inflict, or the grief for their ſlain Friends could invent, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding him with his falſe hopes in the Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and objecting

                  </q> They led him bound through the whole City as the mockery of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and vexing him with horrid torments, they at laſt killed him; and cutting off his head, ſent it with the news to <hi>Agathocles</hi> into <hi>Africk.</hi> Thus fell <hi>Amilcar,</hi> who was before the Terrour of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> but now the ſcorn of <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> more miſerable by the hands he fell into, then by the cauſe and manner.</p>
               <p>This rout had ſo broken and ſcattered the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army, that they could ſcarce meet the next day; and when they did, were as far from Union. Their Overthrow had made them factious, and (as it is the faſhion of the Vulgar) each one was ready to charge another with the common Miſery, and object their own Crimes to anothers Malice. This was increaſed by the loſs of their General, and they could not agree of a Succeſſor to him. The <hi>Africans</hi> would have the chief command given to one of their own City, that was next in dignity to their late Commander: but the<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99302:98"/>confederate <hi>Greeks</hi> with the Exiles contended for <hi>Dinocrates</hi> to be ſupreme. And when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party would recede from their deſigned choice, they followed their ſeveral Leaders, and ſo divided.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Agrigentines</hi> conſidering this ſtate of affairs in <hi>Sicily,</hi> were perſwaded that Fortune preſented them with a fit opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Empire of that Iſland. The
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> they conceived were ſo broken, that all they could doe, was to defend their own City from <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s invaſion:
<hi>Dinocrates</hi> with his Exiles would be contemptible to that power which they ſhould raiſe: The <hi>Syracuſans</hi> being half-famiſh'd, would bend all their cares rather for food then dominion; or if they ſhould be yet ambitious to retain their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, yet their preparations for it would be ſo ſlow, that they could make no conſiderable attempt before they had rooted their power, and ſetled their dominion. The ſpeedy growth of which their own arts promiſed, and the pretext which they would uſe for their deſign, which was, <hi>to ſet all the Cities in</hi> Sicily <hi>at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:</hi> for the hate of Forein yoke, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> the innate thirſt of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which was in the
<hi>Greekiſh</hi> blood, would eaſily make their pretext be credited and complied with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:99302:99"/>Swoln with theſe hopes the
<hi>Agrigentines</hi> make one of their own Citizens, <hi>Xenodicus,</hi> General, and furniſhing him with a ſufficient Army ſend him forth to execute their counſels. He firſt marches to <hi>Gela,</hi> where being received by ſome whom he had before practiſed with, he enters the Town by night, and becoming maſter of it, he there gathers up a large ſumme of Mony, increaſes his Forces, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by force, partly by perſwaſions, draws the <hi>Geloans</hi> into a Confederacy with the <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> The fame of this plauſible deſign being bruited abroad, all the Cities that were not ſuppreſſed by a greater force then their own, greedily embraced this Overture of Liberty, and joined with the Undertakers. The <hi>Ennei</hi> and the <hi>Erbeſſites</hi> being aſſiſted by <hi>Xenodicus</hi> drove out the <hi>African</hi> Garriſons. Then he haſtens to deliver the
<hi>Camarinaei</hi> and <hi>Leontini</hi> from the incurſions of the
<hi>Syracuſans,</hi> who, like thieves broke our of priſon, being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Siege, were more fierce and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, waſting and pillaging all their Neighbours, and had taken <hi>Exetla.</hi> Thither the
<hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſpeeds, drives the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> within their own walls, beſieges and takes <hi>Exetla,</hi> and reſtores it to its own Democratical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Syracuſans</hi> being thus hindred from forraging by land, took advantage of the <hi>Punick</hi> negligence, whoſe Fleet ſeemed to be ſtupified with the reiterated loſſes of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99302:99"/>and ſo were more negligent in their guards: So that the enemy got in by Sea ſome Veſſels laden with Corn that did for a time ſupply their great wants. In the mean while the Army of the League, to keep up their growing fame, marches up and down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers ſeveral Towns both from the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> and <hi>Carthaginian</hi> yoke. Thus while <hi>Carthage</hi> and the Tyrant contended for the Empire of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and waſted each other with repeated fights, there ariſes a third party to take the ſpoils of both. But the miſeries of the Iſland were ſtill increaſed by the pretenders to her Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and could not fear or ſuffer much more troubles in Slavery, then what now ſhe muſt endure for the vain hopes of that Liberty which the next ſtrong Pretender would raviſh from her.</p>
               <p>While theſe impetuous deſigns for Empire and Liberty waſted and almoſt drowned <hi>Sicily</hi> in blood and tears, the Tyrant's ſucceſs in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> made him gay and jolly: and when he had received the head of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> (who living was his greateſt terrour) he made uſe of it to terrifie his own Citizens; for riding ſo near their Camp as that he might be heard and ſeen, he ſhews them the remains of their ſlain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and makes up the ſtory of his death with all the dreadful paſſages that might augment their fears. The <hi>Africans</hi> with tears paid<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99302:100"/>their reſpects to his unfortunate faith and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and bowed down to worſhip that head which was their Enemies ſcorn; bewailing in the loſs of him the unhappineſs of <hi>Carthage.</hi> But the other miſchiefs of War which followed did dry up the tears too ſoon for this their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captain.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange ſucceſs both in <hi>Sicily</hi> and
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> made the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Potter more proud, ſo as to perſwade himſelf that he ſtood above the reach of Danger. But the great Ruler of humane affairs deals ſometimes with Tyrants as he hath done with the Lions of <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> whoſe Fierceneſs would make that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try deſolate and the waies unpaſſable, had not Nature provided a little ſort of Flies, that about the heat of day flying into the eyes of thoſe beaſts, either force them into Mariſhes and Fenny places there to preſerve their ſight from thoſe enemies, whom ſmalneſs makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible; or elſe exaſperating their revenge to kill them, while they are wounding, make them tear out their own eyes with their claws, and ſo ſtarve for want of ſight and food. So Providence reſtrains the fury, and curbs the Pride of ſuch Monſters as Tyrants are, by ſome abject means and inconſiderable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, forming their Ruine from unſuſpected beginnings. Drunkenneſs and Feaſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times revenge the oppreſſed world, &amp; overthrow<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99302:100"/>that power which is unreſiſtible by Arms. Thus <hi>Agathocles</hi> was almoſt ruined, when his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were moſt weak, by an unexpected Mutiny of his own Army, occaſioned by a ſlight accident which gave beginning to it. And <hi>many times ſmall beginnings have great effects, men being more willing to follow a motion then to lead it.</hi> The Tyrant jolly in his Succeſs and the obſequiouſneſs of Fortune, invites all his Officers to a Supper; where one of them, named <hi>Lyciſcus,</hi> being drunk, began to rail at him, and upbraided him with his notorious Crimes, uttering ſuch ſpeeches that were not ſafe in a Tyrant's ears. <hi>Whoſe Maximes are to hate even the liberty of ſpeech, and to ſuſpect thoſe who ſpeak either boldly or gravely, for underminers of Tyranny. Agathocles</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Anger, reſerving it to grow more beavy in a fit ſeaſon of Revenge; at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſeemed to reverence the man whom he had often proved very valiant, and therefore imputing his Paſſion to his diſtemper, replies onely by jeaſts and contempt, the ſooneſt way to blot out reproaches. But his Son <hi>Archaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> (who thought his Father's fortune needed no Patience, and becauſe the drunken ſpeeches had ſo much of truth that they left too ſharp a remembrance) with much fury returns the like language mixed with Threatnings. This heat outlaſted the Feaſt, and every one departs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Tent. But <hi>Archagathus</hi> following<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99302:101"/>and preſſing upon <hi>Lyciſcus,</hi> he did at laſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him alſo of Inceſt with his Fathers Wife <hi>Alcia.</hi> Upon which
<hi>Archagathus</hi>'s blood boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as high in choler to have his Crimes divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as it did before in Luſt, and as he was prompt to doe any baſeneſs, ſo he was equally inſolent, and unwilling to hear of it, he ſnatches a javelin from one of the Guard, and runs <hi>Lyciſcus</hi> quite through the body; who falling down dead was by his Friends conveyed to his Tent. Whither as ſoon as it was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were gathered all his acquaintance, and many of the Officers of the Army; who had a reſpect for him, not onely for his Valour, but alſo for the bluntneſs of his diſcourſe, which did ſeem to have in it a ſhew of a free Soul. Theſe reſenting the injury done to their Friend, and meaſuring their own danger by what he had ſuffered, fill the whole Camp with Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was more inflamed by all the great Officers, who feared the Tyrants wrath for ſome ſlight offences. So that at laſt every one armed themſelves to puniſh the inceſtuous Murderer, and to appeaſe the angry ghoſt of their Friend with his enemy's blood; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that if <hi>Agathocles</hi> would not deliver him up to Juſtice, they would ſatisfie their fury with his head. Then did their anger invent new cauſes of quarrel, and clamoured out for their arrears; and to ſhew their intentions for a real ſatisfaction, they choſe them new
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99302:101"/>Leaders, ſeized upon all the Forts and Gates of
<hi>Tunis,</hi> and ſet a guard upon the Tyrant and his Son. Thus, as <hi>it is the nature of the Multitude either baſely to ſerve, or proudly to domineer,</hi> they had in a moment caſt off all that fear and reverence of the Tyrant, which ſo many terrours and ſo long a Conduct had habituated them unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> all this while, in the conſcience of many Wickedneſſes which every mouth now ſpoke of, did not dare to appear, to reſtrain thoſe that were moſt fierce, or reconcile the doubtful, or animate any of his Confidents; but fearful and ſluggiſh, watched when this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour would ſpend it ſelf. But the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that had intelligence of the Mutiny, laboured to advantage themſelves by it, before the love of Obedience or the knowledge of the neceſſity thereof ſhould return: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent ſome ſecret inſtruments to practice them to a Revolt, promiſing to pay all their arrears, and ample rewards to the Agitators in it, ſo that many of the Officers undertook the emploiment.
<hi>Agathocles</hi> ſtartled at theſe practices, thought his life and fortunes were now at the utmoſt verge, and fearing if he were delivered up to his Enemies, he muſt with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and torture end his daies, he conceived it better to commit himſelf to the fury of his own Army; and ſince his Life was gone, he<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99302:102"/>would onely provide for the decency of his Death, and withal try whether his old arts of diſſembling would ſtill prove lucky. Onely the doubt was how he ſhould proceed: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould go and oppoſe to their Fury the Majeſty of a Commander, which might force a reverence, when they ſaw a Perſon of ſo great experience, and that had for a long time been the chief fountain of ſeverity and reward; or whether he ſhould go by ſuch a way of fear and trembling as would conceal all his arts of diſſembling and ſpeaking, and ſo be more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to mitigate the incenſed Rabble. For <hi>it is the custome of the Vulgar to be changed by ſudden and unuſual appearances, and be as prone to pity as they were immoderate in anger.</hi> This laſt way was thought moſt expedient; and therefore laying aſide all his Robes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Power, ſquallid and deformed with fear, with a countenance compoſed to tears, yet full of Pride and Anger, he comes into the midſt of the Souldiers, who were preſently moved with the miſerable habit of him whom before they enyied. He ſpeaks to this purpoſe.</p>

For dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents do follow even honeſt actions, if Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence do not moderate the courſe of Juſtice. But his greateſt crime was, that he anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your fury, and prevented your revenge<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99302:103"/>of your own injuries. For though the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of a Prince and the honour of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate were but empty names and vain ſhadows, yet it is your concernment that He which is your Commander ſhould not be eſteemed the worst of men, as that drunken Railer would have rendred me; becauſe that Society is near a diſmal diſſolution, whoſe Chief or Prince may be ſafely defamed. But it is in vain to complain, ſince the Gods have decreed the end of this glorious Enterprize by my death. For who will dare to lead you to fire the Gates of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and to find your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears in ranſacking her Riches, when you have applauded the diſhonour, and conſpired the betraying of your moſt faithful Servant? Or what need the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> fear your arms, when by theſe baſe arts (for by better they cannot) they can ruine your beſt Officers, and make you bind their yokes upon your own necks? I deſire to live no longer to ſee your Infamy, nor will I experience the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty or Clemency of any other, but free and ſatisfied with my own integrity and glory will anticipate all danger. Onely I deſire you, that the ſhort time your cruel and faithleſs Enemy will ſuffer you to ſurvive me, you will remember Me among the brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and put me in the number of thoſe that by an honourable end have eſcaped the publick Miſeries.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:99302:103"/>Having ended his Speech, he drew out his Sword, and put it to his breaſt, as if he had intended to have killed himſelf: which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſo much life, (for he was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mimick) that the rude Multitude, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the arts of Tyrants, and their too much fear of death, thought it was real. Therefore with loud acclamations, and ſtriking their ſpears upon their ſhields, which was the way whereby the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers did uſe to expreſs their deſires, they cried out
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>that he ſhould forbear the ruine of himſelf and them, that they did acquit him of all accuſations;</hi>
                  </q> and with a ſhout begged and gave pardon at once, deſiring him to re-aſſume his Royal habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments: which while he puts on he weeps, and thanks the changeable Multitude, that ſo ſoon was differing from it ſelf, and that before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Fury, did now become all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. For <hi>every Multitude is moveable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of Souldiers; ſo that the remedies of Sedition are as eaſie as the beginnings of it.</hi> The Tyrants Speech having recovered ſo much pity as ſerved him for Authority, and ſeeing the return of Obedience, and that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were now fit to receive commands, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turns the remainder of their fury upon the Enemy, who were expecting the iſſue of their practices, and the Revolt of the whole Army, of which they had received ſome alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Whom when they ſaw marching out, they<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99302:104"/>conceived to be ſuch as had forſaken the Tyrant, and were coming over to them; for the ſpeed of
<hi>Agathocles</hi> had prevented any news of the change in the City: and when he was come near them, he tells his Souldiers,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>that now they ſhould expiate their ſeditious fury, and blot out their treaſon with the blood of the authours, and turn their crime to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
                  </q> Then ſounding a charge, he chaces the <hi>Africans</hi> to their own tents; who being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with this ſurprize, made no reſiſtance, but left many of their fellows dead upon the place, as teſtimonies of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Agathocles</hi> had thus dexterouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped this great danger, and revenged himſelf on the <hi>Africans,</hi> without any other loſs then of two hundred Authours of the Sedition, that had revolted to the Enemy; yet was his hatred ſtill alive of the whole Army, that had put him to ſuch affrightments: and could he have been ſafe, he would have contrived their univerſal ruine. So implacable are the Spirits of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. Yet notwithſtanding he intends to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them, whom the contemplation of their number often incites to Sedition, and makes them ſcorn to ask that pay which they ſee they can force. Therefore leaving the reſt of the Army with his Son, to ſecure <hi>Tunis</hi> and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions thereabout; he takes with him eight<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99302:104"/>thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, and follows the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces, who were gone into
<hi>Numidia</hi> to ſuppreſs ſome Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions among their revolting Subjects. Where though by their ſpeed they had reduced many to Obedience, and by moderating their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands recovered the Affections of others; yet did they not dare to give battel to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but incamped themſelves on an Hill defenſible by nature, and incompaſſed about with Rivers of a difficult paſſage. Then they commanded their <hi>Numidians</hi> that were in arms for them, after their manner of fighting, ſtill to follow the
<hi>Sicilians,</hi> and by many ſudden aſſaults to retard their march. But <hi>Agathocles</hi> ſending out his Slingers and Archers to encounter with them, leads his other Forces forward to find the Enemy; who being certified of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſent out a party to hinder his paſſage at the River, where they ſlew many of his men. But the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> though leſs in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet greater in reſolution, and heightned with many Victories, forced their paſſage, and ſtoutly maintained the fight with the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time thoſe <hi>Numidians</hi> that were on either ſide, forbore the fight, being of an unſteady Faith, like their ſandy ſoil, neither united among themſelves, nor conſtant adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers unto others; and ſtanding like Spectators<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99302:105"/>of the Combate, and as ſo many Vultures watching to prey upon the falling Carcaſſes, they determined to rifle the Camp and luggage of which party ſoever was worſted. At laſt the day inclining to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> he purſued the
<hi>Africans</hi> to their Camp, which being well fortified, they bravely defended, and returned more wounds then they did receive: yet was the Tyrant obſtinate to force them within their defences, hoping to compleat the Victory ſo happily begun. The <hi>Numidians</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſo well preſerving their Camp, though they loſt the field, immediately turn their hopes upon <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s Tents; where killing thoſe few that were left for the guard of them, they took all the Priſoners and ſpoil, and, like birds of prey, when they had got the ſpoil, made no delay, but haſted away. The Tyrant hearing of this, drew off from the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> to ſuccour his own Camp; but their haſte and the approaching Night delivered them from his revenge, and they eſcaped with the greateſt part of the ſpoil. <hi>Agathocles</hi> therefore to ſupply the loſs his Army had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Numidians,</hi> did equally divide among the Souldiers his own booties, leſt they ſhould mutiny. In this Battel were taken a thouſand <hi>Greeks,</hi> whereof five hundred were
<hi>Syracuſans,</hi> who in hatred of the Tyrant had ſerved the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Theſe being all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in a Garriſon, fearing the Cruelty of<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99302:105"/>the Tyrant, by night ſet upon the guards; but being worſted, retired into a ſtrong place, which they intended to defend till they might have good Articles. <hi>Agathocles</hi> hearing of it, draws up his whole Army againſt them, whom the fear of preſent death made forgetful of the Perfidiouſneſs of the Tyrant, and ſo they yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up themſelves upon his Oath that he would ſpare their Lives: which they had no ſooner done, but he kills them every man.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Overthrows, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not broken in their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution for Empire; (which is alwaies the guiſe of great ſpirits, not to vary with their fortunes) and therefore did ſo little repent of their unhappily-defended Liberty, that they choſe rather to be overcome then not to attempt at Victory. A temper they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as long as they had a City. For in their laſt War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> before ever they would yield to quit their City, they pulled down their Houſes for timber to build a Navy; and when they wanted Iron and Braſs, they melted their Gold and Silver for the ſame uſes; and their Matrons cut off their Hair, to make cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage for their Engines. This undaunted reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, their ſending forth freſh Armies, their warineſs of engaging, the hardineſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which by their continual Conflicts they had acquired, the difficulties of this laſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99302:106"/>Skirmiſh, and the much blood the Victory coſt him, made the Tyrant ſee how unequal ſuch a petit Prince as he, and a ſingle City that was blocked up, and could afford him no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for ſo vaſt deſigns, were to ſo mighty a Commonwealth, that ſeemed inexhauſtible in her Treaſures, and ſtore of men, and that at this rate they could longer hold out with their Overthrows, then he with his Victories: for his Forces were worn out with the Succeſſes, and there could be little truſt in the Souldiers he gathered from the conquered people. He therefore caſts about to get thoſe ſuccours ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe that he could not expect from home. Among thoſe whom he thought on, none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo fit for his deſign as
<hi>Ophellas,</hi> who having been one of the Commanders of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> in the partage of that Empire had ſeized upon
<hi>Cyrene</hi> in <hi>Libya,</hi> and had made himſelf Prince thereof; with which it was known that he was not contented, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had many projects to enlarge his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and make himſelf eminent.</p>
               <p>This man <hi>Agathocles</hi> judged fitteſt for his purpoſe, and eaſieſt to be impoſed upon. For <hi>Ambition infatuates, and while it preſents the luſtre of Greatneſs, dazles the Reaſon, that it cannot ſee the dangers and difficulties in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, nor look into the practices of thoſe that tempt them.</hi> To him therefore the Tyrant
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99302:106"/>ſent <hi>Ortho</hi> a <hi>Syracuſan</hi> as Ambaſſadour, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole him into this war, and as a reward of his dangers makes profer of all the acquiſitions he had already made, or ſhould hereafter make by their joint Forces in <hi>Africk.</hi> For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Sicily</hi> an Empire large enough for his ambition, who modeſtly thought too great a Command was dangerous, and in great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions men made themſelves too obnoxious to the ſtrokes of Fortune. He had made this war upon the Continent onely to divert the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi> from the Iſland, and to blot out the ignominy of his overthrow at <hi>Himera,</hi> not to ſettle a Kingdome there, which was divided by ſo vaſt a Sea from his principality of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> If hereafter his deſires ſhould be enlarged with his Fortunes, he had <hi>Italy</hi> nearer him, a place fitter for his deſigns, and where he had better pretenſions, and there he ſhould exerciſe his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and enlarge his Empire; but all <hi>Africk</hi> he would leave to <hi>Ophellas,</hi> as fitteſt for the King of
<hi>Cyrene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This wrought the deſired effect on <hi>Ophellas,</hi> who having been long waiting for ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, greedily ſwallowed the bait. For <hi>men are more deſirous of acquiring that which is anothers, then careful to preſerve their own.</hi> This made him not reflect upon the party with whom he had to doe: but as one of the leſſer birds of prey, who are eager to ſeize on that<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99302:107"/>which their nature incites them to, but do not look unto a greater fowl which is above them, and ſeeks to ſwallow them with their ſpoil; ſo he onely conſidering the Empire of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> did not mind the infamous Perfidy of <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> but haſtily concludes a League with him, and provides for the Expedition. To this end he ſends Mony and Officers to <hi>Athens,</hi> from whence he had married a Wife of the ſtock of the famous <hi>Miltiades,</hi> that by the favour of her Friends they might levy Souldiers there, and gather up ſome other un-emploied <hi>Grecians;</hi> who were eaſily perſwaded to this enterprize, for they found <hi>Greece</hi> a moſt troubleſome place, waſted and harraſſed by the ſeveral pretenſions and wars of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Commanders, and therefore hoped for a more ſafe and eaſie War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare with richer ſpoils in <hi>Africk,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to themſelves the pillage of <hi>Carthage.</hi> With an Army made up of ſuch
<hi>Ophellas</hi> marches from <hi>Cyrene</hi> with above ten thouſand foot, ſix hundred horſe, and a hundred chariots that were furniſhed with three hundred men; and beſides thoſe that were liſted there followed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten thouſand with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in hope of booty and ſpoil, as if they went to plant Colonies, not fight Battels, in <hi>Africk.</hi> Theſe travelling through the dry and ſandy Deſarts of <hi>Libya,</hi> where they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in great diſtreſs both of water and victuals, and often hurt by thoſe Serpents which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99302:107"/>to that ſoil, at the end of two months came to the Camp of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> tired and half famiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Tyrant went out to meet <hi>Ophellas;</hi> whom he entertains at firſt with prodigal careſſes, ſends him convenient and ſeaſonable Preſents, often entertains him at Feaſts, in tenderneſs perſwades him to reſt and refreſh his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought them to action, and agrees with him in all the Counſels concerning the management of their Enterprize. One through Fraud, the other through Facility, mutually grant and receive every thing. <hi>Ophellas</hi> adopts <hi>Archagathus</hi> for his heir to his hoped King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and <hi>Agathocles</hi> ſuppreſſes for a while his bloody and greedy diſpoſition; which was impatient in ſociety of Command. Yet all the while he had an eye upon his new Gueſt; and having intelligence about him, when he underſtood that <hi>Ophellas</hi> was moſt ſecure, and that the greateſt part of his Forces were gone forth to forage, he ſuddenly calls together his own Souldiers, and to them declares, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>he had found by experience, how impoſſible it was that there ſhould be Faith and Concord betwixt two Commanders in chief: for <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phellas,</hi> whom he had called to their aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and invited to a Confederacy in that rich War, had notwithſtanding ungrateful practices to cut them and him off; and of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99302:108"/>this he was aſſured by the Intelligence he kept about him: that therefore they ſhould adviſe what courſe was fitteſt for their ſafety.</hi>
                  </q> They were ſoon exaſperated by this falſe accuſation, and deſired him to lead them out to revenge: Which he preſently did, and found <hi>Ophellas,</hi> ſuſpecting no ſuch uſage, without any ſtrength about him, and therefore eaſily maſtered, though he made a ſtout reſiſtance, till he was killed. When he was diſpatched,
<hi>Agathocles</hi> forced and perſwaded the reſt to lay down their arms, and ſurrender themſelves to his conduct, promiſing them that they ſhould find better hopes under his Command then was to be conceived from
<hi>Ophellas:</hi> and ſo wrought over his whole Army. Of which ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Service (together with the Spoils of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phellas</hi>) he ſhips for <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> but they were all loſt by Shipwreck; ſo that the Tyrant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not any benefit of his Perfidiouſneſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of what he had ſent away or what he kept; for it was not long after that thoſe men whom he had deprived of a Captain, did revenge the injury in the blood of his Son.</p>
               <p>At the very time that <hi>Agathocles</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to
<hi>Ophellas,</hi> as if ſome perfidious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence did then work upon all corrupted minds, did <hi>Bomilcar</hi> attempt the like upon his own Citizens. Who though he was ſuſpected to have a long time intended the Tyranny, yet
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99302:108"/>was ſtill ſuffered to continue in the City; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more powerful Enemy and greater Fears employing all their thoughts, and ſo cauſed a neglect of his practices: or elſe <hi>Carthage,</hi> as all Commonwealths, was too ſlow in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, leſs wary in their proceedings, and much reſpectful of their greateſt Citizens; which make Conſpiracies againſt them more ſecure in the management, then ſuch as are formed againſt Princes. He had often ſought an opportunity to ſatisfie his Ambition. But <hi>great Crimes are full of Fears, Delaies, and frequent change of Counſels; and that which in the projection ſeems ful of its reward, when it comes to be acted looks big with danger.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had long deferred his Enterprize. But now, when the City was dejected by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Enemies in the coming of <hi>Ophel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and the moſt eminent of the Nobleſs were emploied in <hi>Numidia</hi> to keep their ſubjects quiet, he thought the afflighted Multitude would tamely ſubmit to him, and that now there was no reaſon to delay thoſe counſels, which are never praiſed till they be acted.</p>
               <p>Therefore when <hi>Agathocles</hi> was buſied in the murder of
<hi>Ophellas,</hi> he began his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. And it was for the happineſs of either State that theſe Crimes were acted in the ſame juncture of time, and that each were ignorant of the others attempts and troubles. For had
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99302:109"/>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> known the practices of
<hi>Bomilcar,</hi> he might have eaſily wrought him, upon the failure of his attempts, rather to have given up the City into his hands, then truſted himſelf to the mercy of his incenſed Citizens. And had the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> been acquainted with the <hi>Syracuſan</hi>'s perfidious dealing with <hi>Ophellas,</hi> it had been more poſſible for them to have drawn that injured Army to their ſide, then for
<hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> that had provoked them with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Baſeneſs. But the Wickedneſs and danger of either Act hated the light, required ſecrecy, and faſtned the attentions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors from conſidering what was done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bomilcar</hi> therefore not ſeeking for aid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, nor mingling Counſels with <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> who he might ſuſpect would be as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as himſelf, but relying on his own ſtrength, which was five hundred of the baſer Citizens, that were eaſily allured with the hopes of Spoil, and a thouſand Mercenaries that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, proclaims himſelf
<hi>King.</hi> Then marching from the place where they at firſt rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous'd, which was in that part of <hi>Carthage</hi> which was called the
<hi>New City,</hi> he divided his party into five bodies, and ſent them by ſeveral avenues into the <hi>Piazza,</hi> commanding them to kill all they found in the ſtreets, that ſo he might affright the people, and make his deſign<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99302:109"/>eaſier. For <hi>if the Multitude be not affrighted, they become terrible; but when they begin to fear, they grow weak to contempt.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Citizens were at firſt affrighted, ſuppoſing this Tumult was cauſed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to whom the City had been betraied; and ſo fled, and hid themſelves. But being at laſt acquainted with the truth, Hatred and Anger (the two ſtrongeſt and moſt ſudden Paſſions) that one of their own City ſhould increaſe their Miſery, and attempt their Bondage, while they were reſiſting a forein Tyrant, expelled their fears, and armed all the Youth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Who gathering together in ſeveral bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, led by the wiſeſt Citizens, who would not ſuffer the conſent and firſt indignation of ſo great a multitude to languiſh, ſet upon the Tyrant in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> whither he was then arrived. He being bravely aſſaulted by theſe, and there being alſo from the Houſes round about the Market-place poured all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death and anger that Women and Children could manage, upon his party; ſo many of them were killed or wounded, that he was forced to quit his ground, and draw off to the place from whence he at firſt ſet forth. But his flight emboldened and increaſed his Enemies, and in his retreat through the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lanes many more of his men were much wounded from the Houſes; and when he came to the place he intended, they cloſely beſieged<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99302:110"/>him. <hi>Bomilcar</hi> ſeeing his deſign broke, parlies with his beſiegers, and with as much Baſeneſs as he had begun with Villany, he puts an end to his ambitious hopes, yielding himſelf up upon Articles of Impunity.</p>
               <p>All the reſt that had been his Inſtruments were pardoned, their Miniſtery to his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being imputed to their Weakneſs: and it was not ſafe now to draw much blood within their walls, when ſuch rivers were ſpilt without. Onely the Tyrant himſelf muſt by his death ſeal the ſecurity of the Commonwealth, and ſatisfie the publick hatred. For
<hi>hatred that is raiſed by danger out-laſts the fear; nor doth the conquered ceaſe to be hated till he ceaſe to be.</hi> Therefore notwithſtanding the Publick faith for his impunity, he was moſt cruelly tortured, and afterwards crucified. He ſhewed himſelf conſentaneous in life and death; for from the Croſs, as from a Throne, his Imperious and Proud ſpirit declamed againſt the Ingratitude and Cruelty of the
<hi>Carthaginians:</hi> Objecting to them how they murdered <hi>Hanno,</hi> whom they had falſely accuſed with the affectation of Tyranny; baniſhed
<hi>Giſgo,</hi> whoſe Innocency their Wickedneſs could not endure; baſely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed private ſentences of death againſt his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<hi>Amilcar,</hi> who wiſely endeavoured to make <hi>Agathocles</hi> rather their Friend then their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and in this fury, becauſe he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99302:110"/>the Crimes he objected, he breathed out his reſtleſs ſoul. Thus <hi>Conſpiracies, if they do not ruine, yet defame the Magiſtrate; and when they thrive not againſt them, are ſuppoſed to come from them as inventions to cover their Avarice in ſeizing upon the Eſtates of others, or to hide their inhumane thirſt of blood.</hi> This was the end of <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> who following the ſame deſigns with
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> had yet a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent iſſue; for the Croſs rewarded his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, when Power and Greatneſs was the price of the others. Not to refer this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence either to the Juſtice of Heaven, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving one to be more wicked then the other, and that he which thrived was leſs impious then he that periſhed in the undertakings; for this would injure that immaculate Juſtice and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heaven: nor to aſcribe it to the pity of Providence, who would not afflict the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that laboured under the fury of a moſt bloody forein Enemy, with thoſe greater miſchiefs that follow a change of Government, and of neceſſity flow from a Domeſtick Tyranny. But we may in reaſon aſſign this cauſe, that the different events did ariſe from thoſe divers Occaſions which either took for his Enterprize. The <hi>Syracuſan</hi> found a corrupted State to work upon, (for in none but ſuch do Tyrants ariſe;) but the <hi>African</hi> did not: For whereas a State is corrupted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through a long Proſperity, or variety of<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99302:111"/>Factions in it, both which make the People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from their ancient Conſtitutions; <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> at this time was delivered from both theſe ſprings of Corruption; becauſe being preſſed with a tedious and cruel War, they were all united againſt the Common Enemy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight for their preſervation, they could not attend the ſatisfaction of thoſe Luſts which are moſt petulant againſt the eſtabliſhed Laws. Which <hi>Bomilcar</hi>'s impotent ambition not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, nailed him to the Croſs, in ſtead of fixing him on a Throne.</p>
               <p>About this time all the Family of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great was quite extinguiſhed. His Brother <hi>Aridaeus</hi> with his Wife
<hi>Eurydice</hi> were killed by his Mother <hi>Olympias:</hi> She afterwards beſieged, and by Famine forced to deliver up her ſelf to
<hi>Caſſander,</hi> was by him murdered. <hi>Roxane</hi> his Wife, with her Son the younger <hi>Alexander,</hi> fell by the ſame hand; and ſo alſo
<hi>Hercules</hi> his Son by <hi>Barſine.</hi> His Siſter
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> was alſo put to death by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of
<hi>Antigonus.</hi> So that there remained no Heir unto that great Troubler of the world. And he that had ſhed ſo much blood for an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Name, had nothing but that Name left. His Commanders, who as long as any of theſe did ſurvive were contented with the portions onely of that Empire, did after their death aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Name and Majeſty of Kings. Which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99302:111"/>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> hearing, the Potter alſo, who thought himſelf equal to them in Exploits and Conqueſts, and not inferiour in Dominion, would alſo be ſtyled <hi>King,</hi> and wear a Crown as the Enſign of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before uſed but as a Prieſt. But Royalty, which is the reward of Heroick Vertues, may be the Uſurpation, yet can never be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a Tyrant: the Enſigns may be worn by a vitious bloody Villain, but the Majeſty never adorns but a Lawful Juſt Prince. For <hi>Crowns do not create, but elicite that Reverence which the Vertues of the wearer first formed in the minds of men: without which umpreſs Diadems do but provoke the indignation of the beholders, and upbraid, not honour, the baſeneſs of the Uſurper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aſſumption of the Royal Title made no alteration in the nature of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> but in his next enterprize he exceeded his former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity. For intending to reduce <hi>Utica</hi> that had revolted from him, he ſuddenly lies down before it, and ſurprizes three hundred of the Citizens that had emploied themſelves in the neighbouring Country. By theſe men he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers oblivion and pardon, if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Obedience. The Citizens that were ſenſible of his actions in
<hi>Africk,</hi> that his Faith was to be meaſured by his Luſt; that no greater miſery could happen to them then<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99302:112"/>what they ſhould run into if they did expect his Mercy; that they ſhould periſh if they were conquered, and they muſt do ſo if they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred; that there was no choice to be made but this, whether they ſhould loſe their blood with ſcorn and contumely, or ſpend it in a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant defence and revenge; did therefore refuſe all Peace with him. When he ſaw they would not be deluded by falſe hopes, he endeavours to reduce them by their affections, and would ſack the Town by a force upon Nature. For making Engines of wood, on them he hangs the ſurprized Citizens, under the ſhelter of whom he ſets his own Souldiers, and ſo brings them cloſe to the Wall: ſo that whatſoever arms the beſieged did direct to kill their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, muſt firſt wound their deareſt Friends. The <hi>Uticenſes</hi> were at firſt ſtupified by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane art, and in pity durſt not ſhoot thoſe arrows in their own defence, which would ſpill the blood of thoſe they deſired to ſave. But the Enemy preſſing hard upon them, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Liberty to ſuch a dangerous compaſſion; and deſiring the Gods to impute the Cruelty to their barbarous Enemy, they for a long time ſtoutly defended themſelves. But their adverſe Fates ſuffered them not long to ſurvive their miſerable Friends. For the Town was taken by ſtorm; which the Tyrant ſoon fills with the blood and carcaſſes of the defendants: ſome he killed in the heat of blood, many he hanged,<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99302:112"/>he dragged out and murdered thoſe that fled to the Altars of the Gods for refuge, vainly thinking that he might have ſome Religion that had deveſted himſelf of all Humanity. Thus Tyrants manage their Warres not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt particular Perſons and Cities, as againſt the Nature of man. Nor did
<hi>Agathocles</hi> think it enough to overcome the <hi>Uticenſes,</hi> unleſs he had alſo made them pollute their juſt arms in the blood of their Friends and Kindred. The <hi>Romans</hi> bewailed and curſed thoſe Civil Wars which did expoſe the Father's life to the ſword of the Son, and grieved that the Law of Warre did forbid that puniſhment which the law of Nature required: (He fell with glory like a Sacrifice for the publick ſafety, that ſlew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he knew he had killed his Brother) Nor did they more abhorre thoſe vices in their own Citizens, then they did hate them, and ſcorn to make uſe of them in their Enemies. For they conceived that no Victory, where Juſtice and Vertue were not preſerved entire. And by their juſt practices even to their Foes, they overcame thoſe Cities, and ſubdued thoſe Spirits, which no force of arms could ever have ſubjected: and one Generous Example of Vertue hath flung open thoſe Gates, which no humane power could have pulled down. Thus <hi>Camillus</hi> received the
<hi>Faliſci</hi> to obedience; <hi>Fabritius</hi> removed <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> from <hi>Italy;</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Continency reconciled all
<hi>Spain</hi> to the<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99302:113"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Men more willingly ſubmit to thoſe whom, being owners of ſo great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, they eſteem it an impiety to overcome.</p>

<hi>Africa,</hi> and left the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my little or nothing but their own City, he neglects the attempting of that, and abuſes the obſequiouſneſs of his Fortune in more inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable deſigns; infatuated in his counſels, and not conſidering that the Members do more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Head, then on the contrary the Head the Members: that if <hi>Carthage</hi> had been taken, the inferiour Cities muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have followed her fortune; but that being left free and intire, ſhe might provide for the cure of her wounds, and watch opportunities for the recovery of her Empire. But either the difficulties of aſſaulting <hi>Carthage,</hi> or the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> did divert him from ſuch an enterprize, and ſollicite him to a return into<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99302:113"/>
                  <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the <hi>Free League</hi> had confined his Tyranny within the walls of his own City. For
<hi>Xenodicus</hi> had hitherto proſpered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Democratical power to many Cities, and raiſed up the confident hopes of all the
<hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi> to live by their own Laws, which is the true foundation of Liberty.</p>
               <p>To ſtop therefore this current of freedome,
<hi>Agathocles</hi> haſtens into <hi>Sicily</hi> with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, leaving the command of his affairs on the Continent to his Son
<hi>Archaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</hi> At his landing he was entertained with the news of a Victory which his Captains <hi>Leptines</hi> and <hi>Demophilus,</hi> with eight thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot and a thouſand two hundred horſe, had gotten on <hi>Xenodicus,</hi> who had loſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred of his men, and was forced to ſhelter himſelf within the walls of
<hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> The Tyrant makes uſe of this Victory, and marches againſt thoſe Cities that had ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off his yoke, and with the credit of the former Victory reduces <hi>Himera, Selinus</hi> and <hi>Thermae.</hi> Then drawing forth before <hi>Cento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rippa</hi> by night, he was in hope to have ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it through the practices he had with ſome of the Citizens: but the plot being diſcovered, he was forced by the better part of the City, which were not polluted with ſuch infamous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to retreat with the loſs of five hundred of his men. Then being ſollicited by ſome perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99302:114"/>inhabitants of <hi>Apollonia</hi> to come and take their City, before he could reach thither the Conſpiratours were diſcovered and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and he was diſappointed for the firſt day of his expectation. But the next day, not to depart without ſome attempt, he aſſaults the Town, and not without exceeding loſs of men he takes it; where killing moſt of the <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates,</hi> he plundered the whole City, and left it as a monument of his Cruelty.</p>
               <p>But the deſires of Liberty, though overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with all theſe Ruines, were like fires leſs carefully extinguiſhed, which revive with a greater flame. For the univerſal hatred of the Tyrant and thirſt for Liberty moved <hi>Dinocrates</hi> to be an aſſertor of the <hi>Free League;</hi> and he appeared like another Rock to daſh in pieces the violent ſucceſſes, and to be a remora to the Tyrant's Security. To
<hi>Dinocrates</hi> therefore flocked all ſuch as either deſired to be free men, or hated the Tyrant; which were ſo many, as <hi>Dinocrates</hi>'s Army conſiſted of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot &amp; fifteen hundred horſe, all Veterane Souldiers, and Actors in the late troubles of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> accuſtomed to the diſcipline &amp; difficulties of Warre, or hardned with the miſeries of Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With theſe he pitches his Camp in an open field, and offers battel to the Tyrant: but he knowing himſelf too weak to engage, retreats to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſtill followed by his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99302:114"/>Enemy; who cuts off his rear, and wins upon him without loſs of blood. This was a great obſtruction to <hi>Agathocles</hi>'s deſigns: for <hi>wars are managed much by fame, and he that retreats is ſuppoſed to fly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Together with this check to his affairs in the Iſland, his fortune wholly declines on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and that ſucceſs which had ſo importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately followed him there, did as ſuddenly leave him. Where his Army continually waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in ſtrength and courage: <hi>Archagathus</hi> either failing in his Father's arts, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a Leader; (For <hi>an Army is to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at the rate of the Commander, whom they will contemn if he be weak, and ignorant of his charge, and ſo neglect their duty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſolent and contumacious</hi>) or oppreſſed with the ſins and fates of his Sire; the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to wicked Parents being entailed by the Divine Vengeance on their hateful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He ſoon found his Inſolencies under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that had been built upon his Father's fortune. His firſt enterprizes were auſpicious, but the iſſue was full of deſpair. For having ſent out a party under the conduct of <hi>Euma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> they had maſtered many Cities in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Africk</hi> with much ſlaughter, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed their Walls, captivated and ſold the Inhabitants, burnt their Houſes, and waſted their Fields, and ſo proud with Victory and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99302:115"/>with Spoils returned to <hi>Tunis.</hi> But being ſent out again, the ſecond Expedition proved not ſo fortunate: for going beyond the bounds of their former Conqueſts, and ſetting upon the City <hi>Miltine,</hi> they were from thence driven with exceeding loſs. Then turning themſelves againſt the <hi>Pithecuſans,</hi> (a kind of people in
<hi>Africk</hi> that have their names from the Apes, whom they worſhip with the ſame reverence as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> do their Dogs) they took one of their ſtrongeſt Cities, and the reſt yielded. But the <hi>Libyans</hi> awakened with the continual clamours of their waſted Neighbours, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a great body, and forced them with more terrour and leſs ſpoil then they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to retire towards <hi>Archagathus,</hi> that was now amazed with Ruines on every ſide.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by their frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters arriving to more experience and greater hardineſs, and by their many Loſſes learning ſafer counſels, had wholly changed their arts and cuſtomes of fights. They were now more wary in their engagements, forbore forward onſets, and uſed the arts of a Veterane Army. For <hi>many wars that are too violent in their firſt fury, vaniſh by delaies: and Armies that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge their Enemies are conſumed by their own wants, and waſt in their own fury.</hi> They likewiſe reſolved no more to venture their whole force in one body, but divided them into three<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99302:115"/>ſeveral parties; whereof one was to march by the Sea-coaſt, the ſecond was appointed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the In-land Towns, and the third was emploied in the upper <hi>Libya.</hi> By this counſel they ſecured their City from the diſhonour and moleſtation of a Siege. For the Enemy would not dare to lie down before it, when ſo many parties were unconquered in the Field. Nor did they fear a ſtorming of it, wherein there was ſuch a multitude, their walls and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations very ſtrong, and the Sea affording much protection by waſhing the foundations of her rampires. Beſides, by ſending out theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they ſhould eaſe that ſcarcity of Proviſion which began to afflict them; all the Country about being waſted by the Warre, and the number of people almoſt infinite that fled thither for ſafety from the Cruelty of the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> Their Credit alſo, which is of great moment in all Wars, would be kept up by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many Armies in the Field. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was of moſt advantage, it would neceſſitate their Enemies to divide into ſo many ſmall Parties, as would be leſs conſiderable and eaſily baffled. All which Ends they did attain. For their Stores were proportionable to their leſſer number: Their Confederates now reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that power which could not be ſpent by ſo ſepeated Loſſes, and were incouraged in their Fidelity, when they ſaw ſo powerful a defence ready to protect their faith; ſo that many who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99302:116"/>before were afraid to own any correſpondence with them, now freely adminiſtred large Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. And <hi>Archagathus,</hi> as they expected, to keep up his Fathers fame, was forced to break his Army into as many pieces as might obviate the enterprizes of his Enemies: one whereof was to ſecure the Sea-coaſt; another was commanded by <hi>Aeſchrion;</hi> and He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leaving a guard at <hi>Tunis,</hi> marched with a third.</p>
               <p>Thus all <hi>Africk</hi> was filled with arms, and now raiſed in expectation of a ſpeedy iſſue. <hi>Hanno,</hi> that commanded the
<hi>Punick</hi> Forces in the In-land expedition, meets with
<hi>Aeſchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and drawing him into an Ambuſcade routs him, and kills him with four thouſand foot and two hundred horſe; thoſe that eſcaped ſled five hundred furlongs, till they came to <hi>Archagathus. Himilcon,</hi> that was ſent into the upper <hi>Libya,</hi> waits at a certain City for
<hi>Eumachus,</hi> who was returning with his Army heavy with plunder. The
<hi>Greeks</hi> no ſooner came near the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> but they offered him battel. <hi>Himilcon</hi> refuſes not, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their proſperous greedineſs had made them proud and unwary, intends to aſſault them by a ſtratageme; which proved as happy in the event as it had been in the project. For lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving part of his Army in the Town, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſally forth when he began to flie, and<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99302:116"/>to charge the Enemy in the rear when they purſued him, with the other part he marches forth, and fights the <hi>Greeks</hi> near their own Camp; whence after a ſmall oppoſition be flies, as if he were worſted. <hi>Eumachus,</hi> as confident of the Victory, (though he could ſee little reaſon for the Enemies ſo ſpeedy flight, and therefore might have ſuſpected ſome unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual arts) without any order follows them. Which being ſeen by that party which was left in the Town, they immediately iſſued forth with a great noiſe, by that giving notice to <hi>Himilcon</hi> to ſtop his flight; and ſo terrified the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> that they being charged on all ſides, and daunted with the ſurprize, preſently fled. But not being able to recover their Camp, the way to it being intercepted by the
<hi>Africans,</hi> they drew up on a neighbouring Hill, where there was no water: where their Enemies beſieging them, they were partly by thirſt and partly by the ſword almoſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, ſo that of eight thouſand foot, ſcarce thirty, and of eight hundred horſe, not forty eſcaped to carry the ſad news to <hi>Archagathus,</hi> a Perſon too inſolent in his Proſperity with any equality of mind to bear theſe great Loſſes. He having this intelligence, draws back all his forces to <hi>Tunis,</hi> gathers up the relicks of the beaten Parties, recalls the other that he had ſent out, and fortifies himſelf, till his Father ſhould come to relieve him, to whom he had ſent this afflicting news.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:99302:117"/>Theſe great Loſſes were more dreadful in the conſequences; for moſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates that were the friends of the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> Fortune, not of his Cauſe, ſoon withdrew themſelves, and fled farther from his ruines: onely ſome few that did more fear the <hi>Punick</hi> Revenge then affect the Friendſhip of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> ſtai'd till they might reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> by a more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and treacherous Defection. The Enemy alſo drew up all their forces cloſe to his Camp, both to heighten his neceſſities and increaſe his ſears. <hi>Himilcon</hi> beſieged him ſo as he could not forage abroad; and <hi>Artabas,</hi> that had the charge of the Sea-coaſt, came up ſo cloſe, that he cut off all hopes of relief by Sea. So that the Army not being able to break out, nor having Proviſions to ſuſtain them within, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among themſelves, and languiſhed by their own force through want of action. Terrour, Famine and Sedition filled the whole Camp; and the baffled Souldiers, as is uſual in ſuch diſtreſſes, referred their Miſeries not to their own Baſeneſs, but to the Vices and Weakneſs of their Commander. His former Cruelty made him ſuſpected, that he betraied thoſe Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the Enemies ſword, who would have formerly bathed theirs in his blood for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of
<hi>Lyciſcus. Afflicted ſpirits are capable of any jealouſie.</hi> Though it is probable he had no other guilt then the want of a Commander's
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99302:117"/>Vertues. For <hi>by the defects and Vices of a Ruler the moſt proſperous condition of a Society may be overthrown; as by his Vertues the most oppreſſed may be eaſily raiſed: and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either good or bad in a Commonwealth, which may not be altered or alleviated by the Vertues of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> hearing the deſperate condition of his Army in <hi>Africk,</hi> prepares to haſten thither, to apply ſome Remedies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commends his affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi>'s good conduct of the <hi>Free League</hi> had extremely diſturbed, to the care and fortune of <hi>Leptines.</hi> And having gotten as many Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as he could aboard ſeventeen Veſſels, he waited for an opportunity to get out of the Haven, that was then blocked up by thirty
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ships: which was made more proſperous and eaſie then he could have hoped; for at the ſame time there had gotten into the Haven by night eighteen Ships which he had hired of the <hi>Tuſcans.</hi> Their fortunate coming raiſed the Tyrant's courage to a reſolution of fighting the Enemy. To perform it he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> to continue in the Haven, till he had drawn the <hi>Africans</hi> in purſuit after him. So making out with full Sails, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> made up towards him, and the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> after them. <hi>Agathocles,</hi> when he ſaw the
<hi>Tuſcans</hi> near the Enemy, turns back<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99302:118"/>his Veſſels upon them alſo: which unexpected aſſault both behind and before did ſo break their ſpirits, that they thought not of fighting, but of flight; five of their Ships being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taken, and the Admiral alſo ready to be boarded: who to prevent the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and miſery of Captivity, preſently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf. An act more raſh then ſtout. For <hi>it is the temper of a brave Soul alwaies to hope:</hi> which if he had done, he had eſcaped, as did his Ship, which a brisk wind brought off from the Enemy without any farther loſs.</p>
               <p>This ſucceſs at Sea made the paſſage to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> ſafe, opened the Trade of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> which was very ſenſible of her wants, and ſo raiſed the Tyrants hopes in his Fortune, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns another attempt upon his Enemies at Land. Therefore he commands
<hi>Leptines</hi> forth to waſt and forage about all the Regions of thoſe Cities that were at fewd with him, but eſpecially of <hi>Agrigentum;</hi> where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the late defeat given to <hi>Xenodicus</hi> had broken no leſs his credit then his force; his Adverſity having heightned the clamours of an oppoſite Faction againſt him, which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of his Proſperity had firſt formed. If <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptines</hi> therefore could draw him forth to fight, the Tyrant promiſed himſelf an aſſured Victory over a factious Enemy. For <hi>where the Souldiers diſtrust their General, and he likewiſe is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99302:118"/>with them, his Orders are diſputed, and their Obedience given according to their own counſels: Every one will be ready to command and adviſe, and none to execute. It is the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confidence which begets reſolution in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and draws ſucceſs along with it. Leptines</hi> acts according to his inſtructions, and by fire and ſword waſting the Regions of <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> forces into the Town many ſad informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the Enemy was. <hi>Xenodicus,</hi> whom his former fortune and the preſent <hi>odium</hi> had made more wary, did forbear any attempts to reſtrain the fury of the provoking Enemy, nor would he lead his forces to another trial of fortune with thoſe that were ſo lately their Conquerours, preferring ſafe counſels with Reaſon, to raſh which onely Chance could make proſperous. He would not hazard the Safety and Liberty of his City for the ſpoil of the Country, nor gratifie his Enemies ſo far as to ſatisfie their expectation by accepting of a Battel. For he conſidered that though the Number of his men were not inferiour to the Enemy, yet their Courage was, and the Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men bred on Stalls and Shops, not to be compared with the hardineſs and experience of ſuch that were acquainted with the toils of War. But being preſſed on by the Factions of his own Citizens, and continual reproaches of Baſeneſs and Treachery from his own Army, <hi>which when it hath laid aſide the modeſty of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99302:119"/>diſcipline, is extremely impatient of not fighting,</hi> he was forced to be the companion of other men's Raſhneſs; and therefore leading out his Army, he did engage the Enemy, and was as ſoon routed. For thoſe that were ſo fierce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the encounter, were fearful in the dangers of it, and being more fit for a Sedition then for a defence of their City, they ſoon fled, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behind them of their fellow-Citizens five hundred foot and fifty horſe. <hi>Xenedicus</hi> with the loſs of this Battel loſt his Country alſo; for being continually aſſaulted with the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Enemies, he was forced to leave his own City, and by a voluntary exile planted himſelf at <hi>Gela.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Victories could not yet make the Tyrant ſecure, but he deſigns a more baſe and bloody upon his own Vaſſals, who he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his abſence might open their gates to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in
<hi>Dinocrates.</hi> Thus <hi>wicked men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fear, and expect what they are conſcious they do deſerve: and though ſome Tyrants may be ſafe for a while from the puniſhment of their Crimes, yet none can ever be ſecure.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide therefore againſt ſuch practices, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects how he may find out and murder thoſe who were moſt averſe to his Government. In order whereunto he appoints a publick Sacrifice and Feaſt, in pretence of a Religious gratitude for thoſe two Victories, that ſo the publick Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99302:119"/>and exceſs of Wine might take off that guard which the Vaſſals of a Tyrant ſhould obſerve and ſet upon their words; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them to a greater liberty of ſpeech. By this means he ſhould more indear the Rabble unto him, who commonly receive ſuch publick Feaſts as the baſe price of their Slavery, and eſteem ſuch Rejoicings among the bleſſings of Peace, and as the adequate wages for their many years of Bondage. And beſides, he ſhould diſcover the minds of ſuch as had freer ſouls, and their inclinations towards him. His Preparations were anſwerable to his Deſign, and the whole City being reſolved into Mirth, to provoke them to a greater freedome of ſpeech, himſelf laies aſide his Imperial Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, plaies the part of a Mimick, and was profuſe in Drollery, jearing ſome of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and acting their moſt ridiculous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. So that he did tickle the Vulgar rout as much as a Stage-play, or the tricks of Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers. And it was uſual with him at other times, to come into the publick Conventions and Aſſemblies without any guard, and there to provoke the laughter of the people by trivial and plebeian jeaſts, and by mocking and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating ſome of thoſe that were about him. But at this time he made uſe of all his arts; and the more to excite the petulancy of others, he fell a jearing himſelf. For taking up in his hands a golden Goblet, he told the people that<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99302:120"/>he left not off his Potter's trade till he found the way of making ſuch Pots as thoſe. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying thus in his low beginnings, becauſe it boaſted the ſubtilties of him that had raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſuch an abject depth to ſo great an height; or to ſhew how patient he would be of another's liberty in ſcoffing him, that did make ſport with his own Infamy; or, which is moſt likely, it was in him as in <hi>all that have ſinned beyond ſhame, Ignominy is their laſt pleaſure.</hi> So that he was never moved nor did bluſh at that which was the fortune of his birth, when he gloried in the wickedneſs of his life: For when he lay at the Siege of a great Town, the Souldiers in the Garriſon (as it is uſual to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timulate their adverſaries with reproaches, and the Vulgar wits are pleaſed with petulant ſcoffs to vex thoſe whom they cannot ſtrike) would call <hi>Agathocles Potter, and Kilneman,</hi> and ask him
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>when his trade would furniſh him to pay his Souldiers.</hi>
                  </q> He would unmoved reply, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>he would doe it as ſoon as he had taken their Town.</hi>
                  </q> With ſuch paſtime did he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his gueſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe tricks of the Tyrant were variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, according to the humours of the Spectatours. Some that were of a credulous and ſlaviſh temper took them for the evidences of a Popular ſpirit, and a Civil habit of mind, and comparing him with <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> he ſeemed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99302:120"/>more like a juſt and lawful Prince (whoſe Right and Innocency is his guard, and who uſes the miniſtry of men for Majeſty, not Security) then a Tyrant, to whom Diſtruſt is his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt ſingular defence. For <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was ſo afraid of giving any opportunity to the people's hate for revenge, that he ſuffered the hair of his head &amp; beard to grow to an indecent length, becauſe he did not dare to truſt his throat to the razour of a Barber; and when it came to be troubleſome, he ſinged it off with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. But this his Succeſſour did ſeem to them to have more noble arts and freer waies to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf and his Empire. Others, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his former Cruelty and Pride, and were acquainted with the arts of Tyrants, did look upon theſe preſent practices as very omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. For <hi>Uſurpers never ſeek to pleaſe the people but while they are binding the yoke upon their necks, nor are they ever kind but when they are about to kill.</hi> And as the Tragical Poets never bring the Gods on the Stage, but to make ſome diſmal Cataſtrophe; ſo Princes when they deſcend ſo low as to practiſe upon the people by becoming their mockery, ſome horrid ſcene is to be acted by them. They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed not his appearing in publick without a Guard to be any effect of a Vertuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Power, but rather an inſolent triumph over their Liberty, that it might appear he had ſo debaſed their ſpirits, as that they did<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99302:121"/>not dare to aſſault a naked Tyrant. By theſe and the like diſcourſes every one diſcovered his judgement, which
<hi>Agathocles</hi> either by his own Obſervation gathered, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his Spies, perſons whoſe baſeneſs was eſteemed beneath caution, whom he had diſperſed about among the people, to provoke and watch others to their Ruine. And the number of thoſe in whom he found any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps left of their dying Liberty was about five hundred: whom together with ſome other of the moſt eminent <hi>Syracuſans</hi> he invites to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Feaſt; and by his Mercenaries murders them, mingling their blood with the wine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deliverance from ſo many ſuppoſed Enemies, and the ſeiſure of their Wealth, the Tyrant ſuppoſed he had gotten another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that by this means he had raiſed ſuch a Diſtruſt and Jealouſie among the Citizens, (which is one of the moſt eſpecial Arts of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants) that they would not dare to truſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with any ſecret practice againſt him; who had ſuch diligent Obſervers and ſo exact Informers, that would betray the moſt ſimple ſpeeches of a Feaſt and Mirth to their inhumane Maſter. By this appears the curſe of Heaven upon that miſerable people who are ſubject to an <hi>Uſurping Tyrant;</hi> who, <hi>conſcious of the greatneſs of his own Crimes, and that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can alleviate the publick hatred towards him, will no leſs in his joyful then ſad times pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99302:121"/>their Miſeries.</hi> To ſecure that condition which is proſperous as well as to prevent an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Ruine, ſtill habituates him to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the innocent and oppreſs the miſerable; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Pride or his Fear driving him to inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane courſes.</p>
               <p>After this bloody Feaſt the Tyrant together with his Son
<hi>Heraclidas</hi> haſtens to <hi>Africk,</hi> where he finds his Army half famiſhed, all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with confuſion and deſpair, and capable of nothing but fears. To raiſe up their Spirits, and relieve their Wants, he would have led them out to ſome action; but there was no way either for Victory or Plenty, but by firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Punick</hi> Forces which had block'd up all paſſes, in ſuch ſure defences as were impoſſible for ſo profligated an Army to overcome. He therefore applies himſelf to all thoſe arts which might tempt the Enemy from their Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to give him Battel in the Field, and preſents them with many advantages. But the
<hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> that abounded with whatſoever was neceſſary, chearful in the freſh remembrance of their late Victories, and faithful among themſelves, would not hazard a Battel, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that Enemy who, preſſed by wants and weakned with Seditions, would fall by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies.
<hi>Agathocles</hi> when he ſaw all his attempts made the ſcorn of his Enemies, that the credit of his Arms was now fallen into contempt, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99302:122"/>Victuals did more and more fail in his Camp; to recover his glory and recall the ſpirits of his Souldiers, he was reſolved to try raſh counſels, ſince good advices ſucceeded not, and he would force the Enemy in their Trenches. Therefore ſick with delay, and impatient of hope, he leads out his Army, which conſiſted of twelve thouſand <hi>Greeks,</hi> as many <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> ten thouſand <hi>Libyans,</hi> who were of no ſetled faith to either party, and with theſe he aſſaults the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Camp. Though their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for their wants, and their dejected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were not to be allaied or raiſed by any charms of Courage, nor would admit any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſpeech; yet did he, as briefly as he could, while he drew them out, deſire them to
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their former and later Victories; that they now ſtood upon the theatre of their Glory, and trampled upon the aſhes and bones of the <hi>Punick</hi> Armies; therefore now they ſhould go with courage, and for ever cut off that faithleſs and conquered Enemy, who did confeſs themſelves their vaſſals, by not daring to look upon them in an open Field. They were now not ſo much to think of a Battel, as to execute revenge; and that by taking thoſe deſpicable Priſoners within their own Tents, they did ſcale the Walls of <hi>Carthage,</hi> put an end to that tedious War, and reap the harveſt of all their toils.</hi>
                  </q> With theſe ſick hopes he led them on to the aſſault, which the
<hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:99302:122"/>were prepared to receive; and having the advantages of ground, of their works, and the exceſs in number, did eaſily repulſe the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who a long time maintained their Charge and followed their attempt, but all in vain. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> ſeeing no hopes, drew off his ſtarved Legions to their own Tents, but was purſued by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who ſpent all their fury upon the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and the other Strangers, but ſpared the <hi>Libyans,</hi> that by ſuch an indulgence they might be invited to a revolt. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the execution as long as the day and their anger laſted, having killed three thouſand of the Enemy; the reſt with ſorrow and fear got ſafe to their Camp, where they found the ſame wants they left, but made more intolerable by their wounds and ſhame. The loſs of this day and the terrours of the following night made the Tyrant quite deſperate, and drove him out of
<hi>Africk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The night following this Battel was unquietly ſpent in either Camp. The <hi>Africans</hi> proud of the return of their Fortune gave themſelves up to Feaſts and Sacrifices, and with Songs and triumphant noiſes made the Valleys and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Woods to reſound their mirth. And, not to provoke their Gods, in an inhumane gratitude they offered up the choiceſt and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of their Priſoners in a ſacrifice to them. While theſe abominable Victimes were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99302:123"/>on the Altar, a ſtrong wind ſuddenly ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and carries the flame to the hangings of their holy Tent, which ſtood next to the Altar; from thence the flame ſpread it ſelf to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall's Tent, and afterwards catch'd hold of thoſe Tents of the Officers that were neareſt to it. This unexpected and violent chance fill'd all with confuſion; and many of the Souldiers who endeavoured to quench the flame, or to remove their arms and luggage, were conſumed by the fire: for the wind growing higher, had ſpread it upon the Souldiers huts, which being made of dry earth and thatched with reed, were ſoon on a flame, ſo that it became ſtronger then the Army could maſter, and many were intercepted in it. Heaven as it were exacting revenge for their Cruelty to the poor Captives, making them periſh in thoſe impious flames which they had kindled for others. Thoſe that had gotten out to the ſides of the Camp, and from the fire, were incountred with another fear, not ſo real, but as full of danger. For the <hi>Libyans</hi> that were of
<hi>Agathocles</hi>'s party, being reſolved to leave him with his fortune, and were about five thouſand, had juſt at the time that the fire began, forſaken the Camp at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and were coming to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Theſe being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Scouts and Guards, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the whole Army of the Enemy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to aſſault their Camp by night, and in this<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99302:123"/>confuſion by the Fire, which their preſent fears made them imagine he might kindle. This news being ſpread about the whole Camp, every one thought the Enemy had gotten into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that they were all betraied; ſo that no way of ſafety was preſented unto them, but onely flight: which being done without any order or reſpect had to their Commanders, was ſo confuſed, that ſome for haſt broke their necks down the hill upon which their Camp was pitch'd; others were angry at ſuch as ſtood in their way, and through the darkneſs of the night not able to diſcover whether they were Friends or Foes, fell foul one upon another. In this darkneſs, amazement and confuſion, there were many ſlain, and more wounded; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that periſhed was accounted five thouſand. They that had eſcaped all dangers but their fears got ſafe to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and filled the whole City with terrour, relating the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be quite broken, and mingling ſome truth with their affrighted apprehenſions, made all things deſperate, yet very uncertain. Therefore they ſet open their Gates to receive their flying Souldiers, yet carefully watching leſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould fall into the Town with them. But the day diſcovered their errours, and mitigated their fears, though it increaſed their grief and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, when they ſaw the dead bodies of their Friends, and the aſhes of their Tents and goods: they could not conceive it a chance, or refer it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99302:124"/>to Providence, but doubted whether it were not ſome open Enemy or ſome falſe Citizen that had occaſioned ſo much Ruine, it look'd ſo like a deſigned Miſchief.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Camp the remembrance of the overthrow had compoſed all to an horrid ſorrow, they had weak and faint fires, a ſilence like to that of Tombs and Charnel-houſes, their few words were low, and without any comfort, the groans of the wounded were the loudeſt noiſe, their thoughts various and diſtracted, walking about their Trenches like men that could not ſleep, rather then as ſuch that deſired to watch. Their very quiet was dreadful, and preſently were they deluded with as vain fears as thoſe that had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted the Enemy. For when the revolting <hi>Libyans</hi> did not dare to venture farther in the ſurrendring of themſelves to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> becauſe they ſaw the Fire, and heard that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe in their Camp, they returned back towards their former quarters in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Camp. But their motion being diſcovered by the Centinels and Scouts, who by reaſon of the darkneſs of the night could not diſcern what they were, the terrour of the paſt day's over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſuggeſted that they were the victorious
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> coming to give a Camiſade to their Army. This Intelligence was carried to the Tyrant, and the Alarm ſuddenly paſſed over<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99302:124"/>the whole Camp. Every one was diſtracted what courſe to take. Some were to make good the Works; others were for drawing forth: the moſt ſtill contradicted the reſt, without preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing what elſe was to be done. And as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in unhappy and diſturbed counſels, thoſe things ſeemed beſt which they had neither time nor conveniency to act; the continual meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the affrighted Scouts did diſturb their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and every unuſual accident altered and confounded their determinations. By this time the flame of the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Tents grew more conſpicuous, and the exceeding noiſe which their fears made conveyed them alſo to the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Camp. Who then thought the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was ſo near, that it was in vain to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, but all were ſet upon flight. So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly ruſhing out of their Tents, they lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped over their Trenches which way ſoever their blind fear did direct them: the noiſe which their own haſt made did perſwade them it was the coming on of the Enemies into the Camp, and this doubled their haſt, noiſe and fears. And each one laying hold upon another, either to force them out of the way, or to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forward by their neighbours ſpeed, were conceived as apprehending enemies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently were killed by their own fellows. Some were ſo madded with their fears, that they knew not which way they ran, nor which to chuſe, and driving upon the returning
<hi>Libyans,</hi> fell to<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99302:125"/>fight with one another as with the Foe. This hurry continued all the night, all which time their terrours and deſpairs admitted no delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or counſel; till the day diſcovered the mockery of Fortune, and that they had loſt four thouſand men in this confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Occurrences of this night did upbraid the weakneſs of an arm of fleſh, when two ſuch potent Armies were routed and driven out of their ſtrengths by a vain and empty Fear, and put to flie when none did purſue; and when either party did fear, they were mutually feared. Prudence doth ſometimes alleviate the ſtrokes of Fortune, and a wiſe management may be good Diſcipline ſo confirm the minds of an Army, that premeditated deſigns and projects of terrour may become weak and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to the ſurprized. But a coincidence of ſo many various accidents in ſuch a juncture of time neither can the weak ſight of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity foreſee, nor poſſibly prevent.</p>
               <p>The next day, though the light had ſhown the <hi>Greeks</hi> the vanity of their fears, yet no leſs confuſion remained on their ſpirits; they were aſhamed of their frights, and unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the place of their terrour and ignominy, they walked up and down ſingle and heavy, their eyes caſt down, weary of company, and afraid to be alone, yet fuller of heavineſs then<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99302:125"/>ſhame. <hi>Agathocles</hi> perceived this horrour, and thought it no leſs then madneſs to oppoſe ſuch dejected perſons to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that were inſolent with their Victory, the memory of which did with the day reſtore them fully from the affrightments of the night. Beſides, he found all the
<hi>Libyans</hi> and his confederate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi> had left his hungry Tents and declining Fortune. In thoſe that were left he could have no confidence, all being concerned either in the murder of <hi>Lyciſcus</hi> or
<hi>Ophellas;</hi> therefore could not hope that either among themſelves, much leſs with him, they could have any <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which <hi>is the onely comfort and alleviation to the conquered.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, the Tyrant was reſolved to temporize with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and as he fled from the dangers of <hi>Sicily</hi> to the coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> ſo now he would ſave himſelf in the Iſland from the dangers of the Continent. But then occurred to his thoughts the impoſſibility of withdrawing his Army with him. He had neither time nor conveniency of Veſſels for ſo great a charge, nor was the Sea clearer from the triumphs of the Enemy then was the Land. For they had recruited their Navy, and recovered the empire of the Ocean, ſo that without their good leave he could neither ſtay nor flie. To make Peace with them in ſuch a low condition of his affairs, was the greater difficulty; for they were ſo elevated with their preſent ſucceſs, that they knew not<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99302:126"/>how to temper their Felicity by reaſonable Conditions to the Authour of their Troubles, and had already threatned ſuch examples of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to the firſt Invaders of
<hi>Africk,</hi> as ſhould terrifie the future Ages from their imitation.</p>
               <p>Wracked and perplexed with theſe affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations, not once entertaining the generous thoughts, that
<hi>Adverſities are born with greater glory then deſerted; For ſuch are the comforts of unhappy Vertues and innocent Souls;</hi> he at laſt reſolved to ſhift for himſelf, and to carry onely with him his Son
<hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and ſome few privado's, miniſters of his Luſts, and leave the reſt to the malignity of their Deſtinies and the Cruelty of
<hi>Carthage.</hi> He pitied not his eldeſt Son <hi>Archagathus;</hi> for his haughty ſoul and wicked attempt upon his Fathers Bed, made the old Tyrant jealous leſt if he were preſerved longer, he might extend his furious Luſt to his Throne, and practiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Life. For knowing him to be his own Son, he concluded him no leſs Ambitious and Perfidious then he was Luſtful. Which ſhews the Inquietude of Tyrants, who when they have murdered all Vertue in others, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crimes ſecured themſelves from the hatred of ſtrangers, yet want not jealouſies of their own Children, and are affrighted with dangers from their own bowels; whoſe good and bad fame are equally dangerous to their curſed Parents. For<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99302:126"/>if by honeſt arts they reconcile the affections of the people, they are then eſteemed too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular to live under a Tyranny. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies which their Father's lives interpoſe to their conceived hopes, are judged too importunate to be born by ſuch as are able to cut them off. If the evil diſpoſitions of the Sire are traduced to the Soul of the Son, then do they load the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Tyrant with more publick hatred, or terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him with fears of practiſing that on him which he hath done on others. And thus was it with
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> who would at once rid himſelf of his Son and Fears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archagathus,</hi> that knew his Father's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that
<hi>all Tyrants blot out every impreſs of Nature, having no affections but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> was very watchful over his actions, and having ſome ſuſpitions of the deſign, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his Jealouſies to ſome Captains of the Army, and conſpires to intercept his ſlight. The prodigious baſeneſs of the act eaſily raiſed indignation enough to hinder it. That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould betray his Army, and ſurrender them up to a provoked Enemy, was a Crime not to be parallel'd. <hi>Archagathus</hi> thought the injuſtice done to him more full of Cruelty, that he who had ventured his life for his Father's Empire, had been a partner in all his Flights and Miſeries, ſhould now be left alone to the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whileſt his Brother of leſſer merits muſt be<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99302:127"/>the onely companion of Safety. Therefore more angry that he had not his part in the Villany then at the Villany it ſelf, he watched to hinder it, deſiring to be ſaved or periſh together. So that neither of theſe Monſters had any natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either of a Father or a Son, but either would have provided for his own Safety, though by the blood and infamy of the other. When the Tyrant was ready to take ſhipping, his Son gives Intelligence thereof to his complices; who meeting together came all to the Tyrant,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him of his baeſe purpoſes, and charged him not to ſtir from the place he was in.</hi>
                  </q> Then leſt he ſhould firſt practiſe upon the Souldiers, and perſwade them any thing to their own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, (which is no hard task on an unwary multitude) they preſently publiſhed and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the treachery of the Tyrant, that he would have left his Army without any hopes of ſuccour, order, or means for their ſafety; whom he had tempted to follow his capricioes, and ſatisfie his thirſt of power, through ſuch numerous Dangers, and objected to ſo bloody an Enemy, he would now barbarouſly ſell, to redeem himſelf, neglecting the lives and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe whoſe carcaſſes, if dead, he was bound to have buried.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers when they heard this ſingular example of Wickedneſs, and conſidered the conſequences, That none of them ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99302:127"/>to his Wife and Children, Country and Friends, but like an headleſs trunk, having no Commander, without life or name, in a ſtrange Land muſt be the mockery of their Enemies, were amazed, and trembled no leſs then if the Camp had been taken, and that they were now under the yoke. But then Indignation called them from that Stupidity, and in a great fury they haſted to ſeize upon the Tyrant, whom they preſently clap'd in chains. Then being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commander, not knowing whom to chuſe or whom to truſt, when they had found ſuch Perfidiouſneſs in him whom they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by ſo long and dangerous an obedience, they were diſtracted with exceeding fears. For <hi>a Multitude without a Governour is raſh, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and mad.</hi> Theſe were increaſed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching night, and by a ſtrange and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain report, that the Enemy were coming on to aſſault the Camp. The care of the preſent Danger renewed the memory of the former, and they were frighted almoſt to madneſs, and (as it uſeth to be in ſuch Confuſions) every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily ſnatches up his arms, and without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marches out of the Camp diſtractedly, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their defences, curſing and railing upon

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99302:128"/>immediately lead him into the midſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my loaden with chains. This ſudden ſpectacle did ſtrangely affect the minds of the multitude.

Though <hi>Agathocles</hi> had no Vertues that deſerved Pity, yet his fortunes did excite a Reverence.] Others moved with the fear of the Enemy, and hope of his Conduct, joined with the reſt, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cried out, that they ſhould take off his Chains, and ſet him free.</p>
               <p>This unexpected mercy and deliverance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99302:128"/>with the miſerable ſight of the Army's fears and confuſions, would have wrought a commiſeration in any breaſt that had had the leaſt ſenſe of humanity, to have provided for the common ſafety, or obliged to the ſame fate. But <hi>Perfidiouſneſs acknowledges no Merits, and every Tyrant doth abjure Gratitude and Juſtice.</hi> Therefore
<hi>Agathocles</hi> was no ſooner out of his Chains, but while the Army was yet in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and none at leiſure to obſerve him, he makes haſt to the ſhore. And becauſe he had before indangered his own preſervation by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave one of his Sons, he now hates that natural Affection, and leaves them both to endure the puniſhments of his Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and with ſome few of his ſervants gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Ship, and undiſcovered ſails away.

<hi>Agathocles</hi> had the trial of the viciſſitudes of all humane affairs, having a long time been the terrour of <hi>Africk:</hi> He had broken many Armies, ruined great Cities, depopulated large Countries, moiſtned the parching Sands with blood, humbled the Pride of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſcarce left them any thing but their own walls; yet was twice a Priſoner to his own Souldiers, and in danger of death from his own Army; and at laſt blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out all the honour of his Atchievements by a moſt curſed Perfidiouſneſs, and too great a deſire of Life, deſerting a brave Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his own Sons, ignominiouſly flying with one Ship and few attendants, trembling in the memory of his Chains and the terrours of his Enemies; as if he had been deſigned to be the example not onely of the Crimes, but alſo of the Puniſhments of a Tyrant.</p>

He ſeemed now not ſo greedy of the Rewards of Wickedneſs, as delighted with Wickedneſs it ſelf; not being more angry that he had loſt his own, then that he had not got another's ſubſtance, or that every one had not loſt as well as he. The firſt that felt his Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity was the City of <hi>Aegeſta,</hi> towards which he leads out thoſe Forces he had, and demands a contribution ſo heavy as would wholly have impoveriſhed the City, though it was great and populous, and had ten thouſand families in it.

                  </q> The Tyrant was not ignorant of theſe complaints which their Grief made too frequent, and the hopes of<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99302:130"/>Moderation from a Confederate made too bold.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore while their thoughts and anger languiſh'd in complaints onely, he thought it was too great a liberty to be grieved at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; ſo he pretends that they were forming a Conſpiracy againſt him, and declares that he will be avenged in the Ruine of them and their City. And becauſe he knew them to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, according to the practices of Tyrants, he uſed them more cruelly, that others might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture there was ſome great Crime by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the Puniſhment. Thoſe that were the pooreſt of the people, he leads out to the river <hi>Scamander,</hi> and upon the very banks, as if he had had a frolick to colour the ſtreams with blood, he cuts all their throats. The poverty of theſe men made their paſſage out of life leſs irkſome. But thoſe that were ſuppoſed to be rich he kills with moſt exquiſite Tortures, to make them confeſs what and where their Mony was; and to make the terrour greater, he had his ſeveral Engines of Torment. Some he breaks upon the wheel; others he bound upon battering Rams, then forcing them off he daſh'd them in pieces; others he makes to die by degrees, and forces death through every member: Firſt he cuts off their Legs, and as<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99302:131"/>their Confeſſions were ſlow or quick, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his ravenous expectation, ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the reſt, pulling off their Hands, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out their Eyes; and every degree to death was the more ſharp, that they might feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dying, and denied them the comfort of a ſpeedy death. Beſides, that he might outgoe all examples of Cruelty that ever the world ſaw before, in imitation of
<hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Bull, he made a brazen Bed proportionable to the body of a man, wherein the Wretch that was to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured being cloſed with a grate, and having fire under it, was exceedingly tormented: and by this Engine the Tyrant could feed his eyes by beholding the tortures; and it was a great part of the miſery of the Sufferer, to be ſeen, and ſee ſuch an horrid Villain triumph in their pains, and urge their Torments. It is ſome modeſty in a Tyrant, if he look not upon that wickedneſs which he commands. As for the Matrons and rich Widows, he broke their Feet with burning Pincers, pulled off their Breaſts, and upon the Loins of Women with child laid bricks to force them to caſt their birth. Beſides thoſe that did die at the will of the Tyrant, who would rather periſh by another's wickedneſs then by their own, there were many others that ſcorned the miniſtery of ſuch curſed hands to ſet at liberty their free Souls. Of which ſome burnt themſelves, Wives and Children, together with their Wealth, that it might not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99302:131"/>be the prey of the Tyrant. Others embracing the Altars of their Gods, invoking their Juſtice and Revenge as the laſt comfort of dying men, did there let out their own blood. And others went and hanged themſelves, that they might eſcape greater miſeries. So that by theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall waies there was an end put to that flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing City. The whole face of the Town was ghaſtly even to the ſpoilers; but it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any thing to check their Covetouſneſs, who in the ſad Ruines ſought for the Wealth of the deſtroied owners: and to increaſe the gain of his Crimes, he ſold the Children and Youth of either ſex to the
<hi>Italians</hi> for Slaves.</p>
               <p>The City being thus depopulated, he appoints it as a refuge for ſuch deſperate and needy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſhould deſert his Enemies, and come under his ſubjection. And laſtly, he changes the name of the place from <hi>Aegeſta</hi> to <hi>Dicae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opolis,</hi> i. e. <hi>the City of Juſtice.</hi> This he did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to profane the ſacred name of Juſtice, and ſhew his <hi>Contempt of thoſe eternal Laws of Right and Wrong,</hi> by attributing ſo glorious a title to ſo horrid a Crime; which <hi>is the laſt pleaſure and delight of thoſe that are prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wicked.</hi> So <hi>Polybius</hi> relates of one <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taearchus</hi> an <hi>Aetolian,</hi> who being made by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> General in an Expedition to break the League that was between the Iſlands called

But the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian obſerves, that in thoſe cruel tortures wherewith he ended his daies, he met with the provoked juſtice both of God and Man. And ſo alſo did
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> for from a brand pluck'd out of the fire of this City was he and his whole Family conſumed. Or herein the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no more then to practiſe the uſual arts of Tyrants, who to divert the Hatred of the preſent, and the Infamy among future ages, are wont to put the ſpecious names of Religion and Juſtice upon their moſt deteſtable actions. So <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he would put upon the new Crimes which his Jealouſie or Covetouſneſs objected to others, thoſe names which the Laws had appropriated to great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſo gild his Cruelty and Rapine with the titles of Juſtice. And as we have ſeen our modern Tyrants ſtyle their attempts to ruine <hi>Piety</hi> the
<hi>Propagation of Religion.</hi> Such Cheats indeed do for a time quiet the Vulgar ſpirits, who more ſtick upon names then things: yet when diſcovered, do ſo much the more increaſe their Hatred, as they upbraided and abuſed their Ignorance. And <hi>the nobler and more diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds think their miſeries under Tyrants<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99302:132"/>the greater, by the injuries that are done to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Tragedy was acted at <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> for while
<hi>Agathocles</hi> was buſie in theſe Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he receives the news of the death of his Sons. He grieved not ſo much for them, who he ſuſpected were too near his rivals of Empire, but feared leſt the kindred and friends of the Souldiers whom he had betraied in <hi>Africk</hi> would be excited by their Example, to attempt that upon the old Wolf, which they had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Cubs. Therefore by a private meſſenger he commands his Brother
<hi>Antander</hi> ſpeedily to murder the Friends of all thoſe that had followed him into <hi>Africk. Antander,</hi> who was of a baſe temper, and who accounted Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty for Valour, did exactly perform the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and endeavoured to outvy his Brother in blood. For he gathered together for the ſlaughter, not onely thoſe of their Kindred who were of an age fit to take revenge, but even their aged Parents, that were ſo near the grave as that they had long loſt their Senſes: and the ſucking Children, that were not capable to know the difference betwixt Slavery and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Women alſo, that could not be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to overthrow the Tyranny, yet if they had any relation to thoſe whom they deſired to grieve, were all driven to the Sea-ſhore. Where that promiſcuous multitude, (that forced Pity from every eye but thoſe of their Butchers,)<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99302:133"/>while they did expect the ſtroke of death, did waſh that place with their tears firſt, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was to be polluted with their blood; and by their cries and ſupplications drowned both the noiſe of the City and the Waves. Thus tortured with the expectation of Death, and the horrid ſpectacle of their murdered Friends who preceded in the execution, they had at laſt all their Throats cut, and their bodies were thrown into the Sea; which for a great ſpace was coloured with blood, and the marks of the Cruelty were carried to far-diſtant Coaſts. And, which was moſt inhumane, none dared to bewail the miſerable, nor bury thoſe carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which the waves refuſed to hide, but caſt back on the ſhore; leſt they ſhould be thought of kin to the murdered, and be forced to the ſame deſtiny: ſo that the Commerce of humane Nature was broke, and Cruelty grew the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from Commiſeration. Upon ſuch actions as theſe does the ſecurity of Uſurpers depend; ſo that thoſe that have had any ſenſe of Vertue or Humanity, do rather chuſe to periſh in an obſcure Privacy, then aim at Power that muſt be obtained and preſerved by ſo much Impiety, and ſo great Miſery to mankind.</p>

That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might hope for a change of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent low condition, yet he was alſo to fear a greater fall.

They therefore concluded that he was never endued with true Valour, and that his former reſolutions were either but the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a preſent fortune, or the eager hopes of a future; which were but ſpurious ſigns, not genuine effects of a brave Generoſity. <hi>And as good men prevail by Vertue, ſo many baſe perſons do ſometimes by their Vices.</hi> Another ſort judged that all theſe Overtures of Peace<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99302:134"/>were but to conceal more ſecret practices in his Enemies Army; that <hi>Dinocrates</hi> had hitherto either baſely, or falſely, by various delaies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied the ſeaſons of war to his adverſaries, and that this Treaty was but to continue him in that negligence. That the Tyrant knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how dangerous it was for a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have once born the name of a King, and that ſuch when they part with their power, do abjure their ſafety: for if not the publick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, yet private Revenge forbids Security. The memory of
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> was yet freſh; who when he had loſt
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and was beſieged in his own Works, and did ſo deſpond that he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to redeem his life with a voluntary Exile out of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> was yet encouraged to a pertinacy by his friend

<q rend="inline margQuotes">

                  </q> Which ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Tyrant, who was in greater diſtreſs then the preſent, that he retained his power, and weathered out the Storm that threatned his ſhipwreck. That ſure this wily Monſter was as far from intending what he did offer, as ever his unfaithful Soul uſed to keep a diſtance from his Tongue.</p>
               <p>The event gave ſome credit to this laſt conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, for it happened that the Treaty came to<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99302:135"/>no effect. For whether
<hi>Agathocles</hi> did ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intend it or no, yet
<hi>Dinocrates</hi>'s Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made it fruſtrate. <hi>Peace cannot pleaſe thoſe whoſe deſires are immoderate or corrupt: and the deſire of Greatneſs where it is, extinguiſhes all other Affections. Dinocrates</hi> was no leſs deſirous to be a Monarch then <hi>Agathocles</hi> had been, and was as little pleaſed that the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy ſhould be reſtored at
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where none that were Great could ever be ſafe. His preſent command of twenty thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe, together with the diſpoſal of all the Cities that were of the League, of which he was called the General, but in truth was little leſs then the Lord, was not to be parted with for the privacy of Peace, which equally obſcures the brave and baſe, and makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt noble and ignoble Spirits. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe</hi> was indeed his native City, but ſhe would be no better then his Enemy, that would reduce him to the equality of a Private perſon, make him obnoxious to the harangues of unquiet Demagogues and the cenſures of the giddy Rabble. Upon theſe conſiderations he was as untoward to admit of Peace as he had been negligent in proſecuting the War, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found out many difficulties in the Treaty. Sometimes he denied the Gariſons upon jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of his future pretenſions: ſometimes he urged that he ſhould for ever depart from <hi>Sicily:</hi> and another time he required his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99302:135"/>for hoſtages.
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the drift of the man, and that he ſhould prevail nothing by this Treaty, but make them more eager in requiring what they knew he would deny, did yet continue his practice, that by his Commiſſioners he might debauch the Army, buy off the faith of ſome, raiſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their General in others, and ſtir up Seditions and Factions againſt him in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cities. He inſinuates by his agents, that <hi>Dinocrates</hi> did not faithfully intend the liberty of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> but ſought to have that power in himſelf which he envied and fought againſt in another; that he was the great obſtruction of the publick Peace and Happineſs of every City, by refuſing ſuch Articles which a Conquerour would not have denied to the vanquiſhed, and ſo he neglected the ſafety of all thoſe Cities whoſe ſervant he was.</p>
               <p>Whiles he laies theſe grounds for Victory there, he concludes a Peace with the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and delivers up all their Forts and Cities which he had ſeized upon in <hi>Sicily</hi> for the ſumme of three hundred talents and two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand meaſures of corn. By this compoſition he was at liberty to employ all his thoughts &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the <hi>Free League,</hi> with whom he was reſolved to try what his ſecret arts had done, and offer them a ſet Battel in the Field, although he had no more then five thouſand foot and eight hundred horſe, which he did not ſo much<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99302:136"/>truſt to, as he did unto his own practices, and the Vices of the Enemy. The Confederates were well pleaſed with the Tyrant's confidence, who ſeemed to offer up his ſmall number to the ſwords of twenty five thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe, which was their ſtrength. Therefore both parties did willingly engage at a place called <hi>Gorgium.</hi> The Fight was ſtoutly maintained on both ſides for ſome time, and the Victory doubtful, whether it ſhould fall where was the greateſt Number, or the braveſt Courage: but at length the practices of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant began to work, for two thouſand of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi>'s Army, that were corrupted by the Treaty, in the very heat of the Battel went over to
<hi>Agathocles</hi>'s ſide. Which did both raiſe the hopes and courage of his party, and ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the other with this unexpected Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that every one doubting whether his next comerade were a friend or foe, they truſted more in their flight then in their companions, and were immediately routed. <hi>Agathocles</hi> would not purſue his flying Enemies, but by a ſeeming humanity to ſpare his deceived Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he ſounds a retreat from the ſlaughter. So that all the horſe were gotten ſafe to <hi>Ambicus,</hi> many of the foot by the benefit of the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching night eſcaped quite away; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them that were left in a body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had poſſeſſed themſelves of an hill, which they had fortified for their defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:99302:136"/>To theſe the Tyrant offers hopes of Pardon and Peace, leſt deſpair might kindle them to a dangerous obſtinacy, Neceſſity many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men to miraculous acts: therefore by ſome meſſengers he deſires them to come to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                     <hi>Which as before he had entertained with them onely out of a deſire of Peace, ſo now he had no other motives, but by that means to put an end to the miſeries of his Country. That although his condition were now better then it was then; yet he knew, how it became not juſt perſons and generous ſpirits to change their honeſt deſires with ſucceſs. He had never thought any cauſe of War could be juſt againſt the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and that therefore he choſe rather to maintain their common interest, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe ſo many dangers for them in <hi>Africk,</hi> to break the <hi>Punick</hi> yoke; which he had done, had not ſome that envied the publick Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Iſland, diſtracted him by aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his estate here, while he was faithfully ſerving them there. That now if they were weary of a tedious and fruitleſs War, and were deſirous to return to the comforts of Peace, and the pleaſures of their own homes, laying down their arms, they ſhould find a free and ſafe paſſage. But if they preferred the hatred of him to all the bleſſings of Quiet, and would ſtill retain their hostile affections together with their weapons, they muſt make their way with the ſword; and he would extinguiſh their<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99302:137"/>hate of him with their own blood: For they had found (by a ſadder experience then he could have wiſhed) that there was no hope of ſucceſs againſt him, who with ſo ſmall an handful of men, through the aſſiſtance of the Gods, (without whoſe favour there could be no proſperity,) had overthrown their mighty Army.</hi>
                  </q> The poor wretches, though they knew that not any word was true, and had many teſtimonies that not any Promiſe he would make, he did intend to keep, yet becauſe they were hopeleſs of Victory, deſirous of Peace, and contented with Safety, were eaſily delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their hopes and fears to try once more his faith, and accept what he offered before they deſired, a readineſs which might juſtly have moved their ſuſpicion. For
<hi>Tyrants are never forward to doe an act that becomes a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon, but they intend ſome horrid Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which would move bluſhes in a Fury.</hi> The credulous Souldiers accepting his Oath for a ſafe convoy, left their works and arms upon the Hill, and came down to require the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. When they had thus parted with all their means of ſafety, the Tyrant incompaſſes them about (being to the number of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, others ſay but four thouſand) with his own Souldiers all armed. Then the miſerable men perceived themſelves cheated to their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; when they ſaw that they were hemm'd in by an Enemy inſolent with Victory, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99302:137"/>with their Arms, and they themſelves na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, without any inſtrument either for revenge or defence, they concluded themſelves devoted to deſtruction. Therefore falling upon one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's necks, and ſhaking one another by the hand, they gave and took the laſt ſalutes, each one deſiring his Friend and neighbour not to ſeek a different fortune in a common cauſe. So invoking Heaven and the injured Gods to revenge their blood, they were in that poſture all killed by the command of the perjured Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Religion of an Oath uſed by <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and conſtantly practiſed by all U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers, onely to deceive men whom they fear, ſhould their intentions be open, while they contemn that Deity which they invoke and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. So that <hi>Perjury is the evidence of baſe ſpirits and wicked ſouls, and never falls upon thoſe that fear no enemy, or reverence any God. Regulus</hi> ſhall be for ever memorable, as long as Piety or Vertue are in the world, that would not break his oath, though made to ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who he knew would puniſh thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which they ſhould have admired, and would reward his reverence of Heaven with ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as would have been cruel to beaſts. And <hi>Rome</hi> was thought worthy of her Greatneſs, while ſhe bred up her Citizens in honeſt arts, and would not ſuffer the Religion of an Oath to be profaned by any unworthy colluſion. For<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99302:138"/>as ſhe needed not ſuch arts of falſeneſs for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie, ſo would ſhe not permit them to her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for Safety. But they juſtly merit the eternal hatred of mankind, who undermine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and all humane commerce by violating the ſacred obligation of an Oath, either to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at power, or to ruine an Enemy that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overcome by honeſt courſes.</p>
               <p>This great Army being onely by the frauds of the Tyrant thus broken and defeated, ſome few of the Exiles he received to mercy; but they were ſuch as he could not ſuſpect for perillous perſons, whom their fears and not courage had herded among the other champions of Liberty, that would be contented only with Life, though it were under Slavery. And to ſuch Tyrants eaſily permit the enjoyment of their miſery. For <hi>their ſafety is founded on the baſeneſs of their vaſſals; and they are alwaies more in fear of thoſe that are brave and noble, though on their ſide, then of thoſe that are againſt them.</hi> Onely the great wonder among the
<hi>Greeks</hi> was, that <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> did admit <hi>Dinocrates</hi> to a compoſition, and kept that faith with him which he did with none elſe: and whereas he was ſo jealous of all others whom he had wronged, or that had oppoſed him, that he never permitted them to live, if he had power to put them to death; yet after ſo long an hoſtility he admitted
<hi>Dinocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to places of truſt about him, and committed to him the command of ſome of his forces. And<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99302:138"/>their faith (if the correſpondence that is between faithleſs perſons deſerve that name) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inviolable by either to their death. Some thought that the favours and averſions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces happened to men, as all other things, by the fate and fortune of their birth. Others conceived that the conformity of their humours, being both ambitious and faithleſs, had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Souls congenial, which might form a friendſhip, when their intereſts were not divided. Therefore the Tyrant had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him ſafe at the Maſſacre at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and now received him again into his boſome at the Overthrow at <hi>Gorgium.</hi> For then their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts did conſpire. <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> that was hated for refuſing the Peace when it was offered in the Treaty, and ſuſpected by all Cities of the <hi>Free League</hi> for betraying their forces in the laſt Fight, could not hope for ſecurity any where but in the Tyrant's protection: And <hi>Agathocles</hi> doubted not to make uſe of that man's Courage and Service, whom hatred and ſuſpicions had weakned and diſgraced ſo far as never to be truſted with any deſigns againſt him: And uſing him in all odious enterprizes, he ſhould thereby derive the publick execrations from himſelf.
<hi>Dinocrates</hi> being thus truſted, becauſe he could hope for no advantage in the deceiving of it, was very induſtrious to reduce to his new Maſter's obedience all thoſe places whom the deſire of Liberty had yet animated to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99302:139"/>And firſt he ſeizes upon
<hi>Gela,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in takes <hi>Paſiphilus,</hi> that had revolted to him. A perſon neither conſtant in his Faith, nor ſtout in his Perfidiouſneſs. With his blood <hi>Dinocrates</hi> aſſures
<hi>Agathocles</hi> of his unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience, and comforts the oppreſſed
<hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> when they ſaw one inſtrument of Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had met with his deſerts. Afterwards he cauſes all the Forts and Gariſons that had been formerly in his power to be ſurrendred to the Tyrant's command, and within the ſpace of two years brought under his yoke all the Cities that were diſaffected to him.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Tyrant, not to forbear Villany himſelf, while his Agents were buſie in <hi>Sicily,</hi> looks about for other places to act ſome miſchief in. And conſidering that the Iſland of
<hi>Lipara</hi> through a long Peace was rich and weak, and ſo could not reſiſt his enterprizes, and yet afford him ſpoils; he ſails thither with his Navy, and ſurprizing them, requires fifty talents of Silver as the price of their Safety. Although they had provoked him by no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor owed him any Subjection, yet it was enough that they were not able to reſiſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and had ſomething to invite his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. The Iſlanders paid him as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they had in their private or publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequers, and deſired a day of paiment for the reſt. For although there was enough Treaſure in their Temples, that was conſecrated to their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99302:139"/>Gods <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> as would ſatisfie the Tyrant's demands; yet had they never been guilty of ſuch a Sacrilege, and therefore would not now pollute their private fortunes, by uſing the conſecrated Mony to purchaſe their Safety, the publick Religion prevailing over their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſts. The Tyrant that had no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in demanding any, would have no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to ſpare ſo much, and therefore forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them and their Gods all the dedicated Treaſure that was in their Temples, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it aboard, ſpread his ſails for
<hi>Syracuſe.</hi> But being overtaken by a great Tempeſt, he loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven of his Ships, which were thoſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſpoils of Sacrilege. The <hi>Lypareans</hi> were a little comforted that their God
<hi>Aeolus,</hi> which they imagined was the Deity of the Winds, had (as they thought) revenged his own injuries, and ſuffered not the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Thief to enjoy the rewards of his Crimes. The <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo obſerved that <hi>Vulcan</hi> their God of Fire took his part of revenge in the death of the Monſter when he was burnt alive.</p>
               <p>So odious were alwaies Sacrilegious perſons even to thoſe that knew not the true God, that all men did curiouſly obſerve and exceedingly rejoice at the Vengeance of Heaven upon ſuch deteſtable Malefactors, which very often ſeized on them in the ſight of men. The true God ſeemed careful to preſerve Religion among men, by avenging the injuries that ware done even<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99302:140"/>to falſe Gods by thoſe that worſhipped them as true. This he often did in pity to the deceived world. For without Religion Communities would degenerate into bands of Thieves and herds of beaſts, each one preying upon another, and keeping no more faith then neceſſity could inforce. That Religion may affect the minds of men, and draw them to an admiring obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and awful reverence of its dictates, it muſt have that Majeſty and Splendour which may work even upon the Carnal part of man, (which is moſt predominant in the multitude.) The luſtre that is moſt likely to have influence on ſuch, is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is derived from the affluence &amp; greatneſs of thoſe things the world accounts deſirable. Therefore the riches of Conſecrations &amp; Anathema's have been thought attractive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients to this purpoſe; becauſe they are the teſtimonies of the munificence of Heaven to its Worſhippers, who in gratitude have by theſe returns acknowledged the fountain of all their Wealth and Happineſs. So likewiſe do ſuch oblations commend the pious Examples and Religious actions of paſt Ages to Poſterity, and provoke them to an imitation. The purity of Religion, though it moſt reſpects the Rational part, and ſeats its Throne in the more Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual powers, yet doth not diſdain the uſe of ſuch attractives for the inferiour Affections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring not onely the Heart, but the Fleſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to praiſe the Living God. And although
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99302:140"/>it expects exact Obedience onely from the purer Spirits, yet it would prevent the contempt of more polluted ſouls: like wiſe Law-givers, who frame not their preſcriptions for the publick Safety with reſpect onely to the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> but temper them ſo as they may allure and invite the obſervance of the dregs of the people. So great is the intereſt of Religion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of its dedications, that few or none did ever bare-facedly own this Crime, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to elude the peoples zeal, and divert the envy of the ſin by ſome more ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to Piety. That ſacrilegious Tyrant who took away his
<hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Golden Coat, and gave him a woollen, did ſcoffingly pretend the change was for the God's advantage, becauſe the Gold was too heavy for him in the Summer, and the Wool was more warm for the Winter: and thoſe that imitate him want not their pretexts of a more refined knowledge of a Deity; that Heaven hath no need of our Treaſure, and is more delighted with a Spiritual Worſhip. But yet we ſhall find none guilty of Sacrilege that are not infamous with other Crimes: who when they have exhauſted their own Revenues in the ſatisfaction of their Luſts, invade the treaſures of Religion to ſupply their wants; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeding covetous, make no difference betwixt things Civil and Divine, and when they have oppreſſed men with Extortions, provoke Heaven with Expilations; which ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99302:141"/>takes Vengeance on their Injuſtice, and in their Ruine recovers the Honour of Religion.</p>

                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> having loſt the Spoils of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Voiage, could not reſt till he had acted ſome more proſperous Wickedneſs. All his thoughts being at preſent frighted with the ſight of the coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> he now turns his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to the other ſhore, and laies his projects for the diſturbance of <hi>Italy.</hi> Which being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known, the ſmaller and maritime Cities of that coaſt that lay moſt obnoxious to his Invaſion and Power ſent Ambaſſadours to treat a Confederacy with him, that by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Friendſhip they might prevent a future Subjection. The Tyrant receives the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with all his uſual falſe Careſſes, puts them in hope of Peace, and entertains them with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diverſions, that they might not have leiſure to obſerve his Preparations. Which when they were finiſhed, he invires them to a Supper, and appoints them the next day for Audience. But he that night took ſhipping, and ſo tranſported his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> while the Cities were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprepared for a Reſiſtance, becauſe they had received no intelligence from their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.

<hi>Brutii,</hi> who loſt one of their Cities called <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas</hi> by the ſudden Invaſion of the Tyrant; but not diſcouraged therewith, they with a great power aſſault him by night, and killing four thouſand of his men, force him back to <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:99302:141"/>Not ſucceeding in his open Force, he tries more cloſe and impious Cheats; for having a deſign upon the
<hi>Crotoniates,</hi> that he might make them ſecure, he ſends a Meſſenger to <hi>Menedemus,</hi> that then was chief Commander there, and had been his ancient Hoſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that he had an intent to accompany his Daughter <hi>Lanaſſa,</hi> whom he had married to
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epire,</hi> as far as <hi>Italy</hi> on her way. And therefore deſires him not to be ſuſpicious of the Navy which he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the ſafety and honour of the Bride. And while he intended this ſoft buſineſs of Love, he deſired that he might not be troubled by them with any attempts of War. They eaſily believed him, who did deſire it ſhould not be otherwiſe; and by this ſecurity they found themſelves altogether unprovided for a Defence, when they ſaw him lay ſiege to their City: And after he had made a ſmall battery upon their walls, fearing leſt a ſtout and vain oppoſition might kindle him to a greater Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, they opened their Gates unto him. Where, as ſoon as he was entred, he uſes the utmoſt Violence, plundering the whole City, and killing all that were able to bear arms, he ſold all the reſt for Slaves. Having deſtroied this flouriſhing City, he enters into a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with the ſmaller Towns that were upon thoſe coaſts, and which maintained themſelves by Piracy, to join with them part of his Ships,<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99302:142"/>and to have his ſhare proportionable in the prizes. Thus he that affected to be a Prince turned Thief, his nature recoiling to the ſins of his private condition, when his outward Dignity required nobler practices; as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the common Enemies, as Pirats are, and to maintain the Commerce of Nations. But a Tyrant doth nothing abhorrent from himſelf, when he plaies a private Thief that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a publick, and maintains but his former enmity to the nature of Man and Nations. By his publick and private Robberies having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited himſelf, he intends a revenge on the <hi>Brutii</hi> for the late loſs he received from them: therefore he invades them again with thirty thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe, and keeps a ſtrong Navy riding upon their Coaſt. A Tempeſt broke and ſcattered his Navy: but his Land-forces had ſome ſucceſs for a time, ſo that he forced the <hi>Brutii</hi> to articles of Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>To give ſix hundred hostages, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Garriſons into their Cities.</hi>
                  </q> But the Tyrant no ſooner left the Continent, and departed for <hi>Sicily,</hi> but they ſet upon the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, kill'd all his Souldiers, and delivered their Hoſtages, and ſo ſhook off his yoke of Slavery, which he was never able to lay upon them again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> finding ſuch variety in his ſingle fortune, which ſometimes was too liberal, and<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99302:142"/>at other times recall'd all her favours by ſome great loſs, like a tempeſtuous Sea, when one wave ſnatches that from the ſhore, which a former had brought to it; he was reſolved to try what he could doe in conjunction with ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Ally, whoſe fortune was more ſteady. And therefore he ſends his Son the younger <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> to <hi>Demetrius</hi> then King of
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> to make a League and Confederacy with him.
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was not unacquainted of the falſhoods of the
<hi>Syracuſan,</hi> and Fame had not yet ſuffered a ſilence of the murdered <hi>Ophel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> could not expect any aſſurance from ſuch a Confederate; who having been ſo often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, could not without a Miracle be true to any: yet was notwithſtanding willing to follow the Tyrant in his own paths, and ruine him by his own arts. <hi>A retaliation ſo conſtant to Wickedneſs, that ſcarce any one periſhes but by the waies he ſinn'd.</hi> He therefore entertains the young Tyrant with great blandiſhments, adorns him with the Royal Purple, and ſends him home loaded with magnificent promiſes and great preſents, and with him
<hi>Oxythemis</hi> a dexterous Confident of his own; in colour to accommodate the difficulties that might emerge in the Treaty, to project a form of accord, and to keep a good correſpondence betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the Tyrant; but in truth to diſcover the intrigues of the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> counſels, and to be a Spy upon the affairs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99302:143"/>the eaſieſt way of invading it, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the Tyrant to ſome deſtructive enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes. <hi>Oxythemis</hi> had an handſome reception, and great credit with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and inclinations he ſoon found, and dexterouſly moved him to renew his attempts againſt <hi>Carthage,</hi> and follow his pretenſions in
<hi>Africk.</hi> This he eagerly proſecuted, that ſo the Tyrant leaving
<hi>Sicily,</hi> his Maſter with more eaſe might attack it. This ſeemed to <hi>Agathocles</hi> as the counſel of his Fortune; for he was now free from any Troubles in the Iſland. <hi>Syracuſe</hi> by an open and continued Trade, and ſome years of Peace, had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſo much Wealth as defaced all the marks of the former War. He was now ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the new alliance of a powerful Neighbour, whoſe aſſiſtances <hi>Oxythemis</hi> after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner did augment and enlarge. He therefore embraced the deſign, and made preparations anſwerable unto it. He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided two hundred Veſſels equipped with all neceſſary furniture for the tranſporting of his Forces, and had begun Hoſtility by interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ships that carried pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Corn and other neceſſaries from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> to <hi>Africk.</hi> But in the very beginnings of his deſign that Vengeance of Heaven which had been long due unto him did at laſt take hold of him, and blaſted his counſels with his Ruine, which was thus effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:99302:143"/>The Tyrant being now old, and doubting the chances of War, and the varieties of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which he had ſo often experienced, would provide for the Succeſſion in his ill-gotten do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion before he departed from <hi>Sicily.</hi> Thoſe whom propinquity of Blood, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Tyrant, and the Vulgar report marked out for the Honour, were the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and <hi>Archagathus</hi> the Son of that

The firſt built his upon the indulgent Affections of the old Tyrant, which he had gained by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervance, &amp; continual preſence, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a quiet induſtry, in all that was commanded, though he were unfit for War, and would wear out daies of action with words of Obedience. Beſides, his late Embaſſie and magnificent reception in <hi>Greece</hi> had made him more ſplendid, though they were but the arts of the Enemy, not the effects of his Merits. And it is not to be doubted but that <hi>Oxythemis</hi> favoured his choice, whom he ſaw leaſt able to hinder his Projects. On the other ſide
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chagathus</hi> founded his pretenſions to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion becauſe he was General of the Forces, and was now with them about
<hi>Aetna;</hi> he had been in ſeveral Expeditions, in which by his boldneſs and generous meen he had got the<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99302:144"/>eſteem of valiant, and the affections of the Souldiery. So that the old Tyrant ſeemed to hold but a precarious Empire of him, which he could take away at his pleaſure. But the obſequiouſneſs of the younger <hi>Agathocles</hi> did over-balance all theſe Merits in the judgement of his Father. Therefore when
<hi>Archagathus</hi> was abroad with the Army, the Tyrant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Son
<hi>Agathocles</hi> to the obedience of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> as the future hopes of all their Peace and Safety, and whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for his Throne. And that he might have the like reverence from the Army, he ſends him with a Letter to <hi>Archagathus,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to deliver up the charge of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the hands of his Uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archagathus</hi> ſeeing his hopes deluded, and that all his glorious hazards were fruitleſs, when the rewards of danger were conferred on him that was never near them; conceives an inexpiable hatred both againſt his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Rival, and reſolves to quench it with the blood of both. To this end he ſends preſently a Meſſenger to
<hi>Maenon</hi> his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at Court, and with whom he had often treated of dangerous Secrets, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him for any deſign he ſhould adviſe him unto, and deſires him to poiſon the Old Tyrant, and he himſelf would contrive the death of the Younger. This <hi>Maenon</hi> was a native of<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99302:144"/>
                  <hi>Aegesta,</hi> where <hi>Agathocles</hi> had acted thoſe incredible Cruelties, and in the Ruine of the City was taken with the other youth that were appointed to be ſold for Slaves. But the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his Perſon had preferred him to the Tyrant's own Luſt, who uſed him as a Barda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio. This he took patiently, and ſeemed to be well pleaſed with his emploiment; and to gain the more Credit with the Tyrant and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of doing miſchief, did glory that he was admitted into the number of his Prince's moſt beloved Confidents, and profeſſed that the preſent Benefits had cancell'd the old Injuries. But yet his ſoul did inwardly burn with a deſire of revenge, both for the abuſe of his Body, and the deſtruction of his City, and therefore was watchful and ſtudious of a fit opportunity to accompliſh it. <hi>Archagathus</hi> was not ignorant of his Diſcontents, and had found him a fit engine for ſuch attempts as his defeated hopes did ſtand in need of. For to enterprize upon a Tyrant by a ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, none are more proper inſtruments then ſuch as have a charge about their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; becauſe they cannot be eaſily ruined but by thoſe whom they moſt truſt, and none are fitter to be wrought to this then ſuch as have been abuſed by their Maſters in their bodies. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that many of thoſe hateful Beaſts have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd out of the world by their forced Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99302:145"/>Beſides, he that is to perform it muſt be a perſon of a firm ſpirit, made ſo either by Nature or Paſſion, and reſolved either for Death or Revenge. <hi>Maenon</hi> had all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, and therefore receiving the ſummons, prepares for his work, and acts it about the ſame time that his Correſpondent had finiſh'd his.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Archagathus</hi> not ſhewing any ſigns of Diſcontent, but profeſſing a ready ſubmiſſion to the Command of his Old, and the pleaſures of his New King, invites his Uncle to a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (wherein he uſed his Grandfather's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, of making Religion the preface to Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany) in an Iſland ſomewhat diſtant from the quarters of the Army, and there making him drunk he cuts his throat, and caſts his dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the Sea. As if he would appeaſe it for the pollutions of the Old Tyrant, who had often defiled it with the carcaſſes of murdered innocents. But the waves caſt it back to the ſhore, and it being known to the Inhabitants, was taken up and conveyed to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> there to vex the eyes and ſoul of his inhumane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who by this time alſo felt the approaches of death. For <hi>Agathocles</hi> being accuſtomed to pick his teeth after Supper, riſing from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble called for his Pick-tooth, which <hi>Maenon,</hi> whoſe office it was to provide it, had anointed with a moſt mortal poiſon. The Tyrant uſing<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99302:145"/>it with a great deal of eagerneſs, had ſoon rubbed all his gummes with it, and immediately felt thoſe exceeding pains which may be eaſily imagined were in parts of ſo tender a ſenſe when infected with poiſon: while <hi>Maenon</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and got ſafe to <hi>Archagathus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tyrant's Diſeaſe every day increaſed, and his Body ſuffering more bitter pangs then ever his moſt ſagacious Cruelty could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for his injured Vaſſals, his Soul alſo had its ſhare of torment in the news and ſight of the ſlain body of his beloved Son. Heaven as it were providing tortures for every Faculty and Paſſion. His Grief was raiſed in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great loſs of him in whom he thought to have eſtabliſhed his Empire, perpetuated his Name, and who, he conceived, would have been a ſupport to the weaker branches of his Family, that now muſt all periſh and be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Ruine. His Indignation ſwell'd high at the too near imitation of his own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that his Grandchild ſhould revenge the miſchiefs he had done to his accurſed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: That all the rewards of his Perjury and Blood, and the fruits of all his Cares and Toils ſhould be ſnatch'd away from him in a moment, and while he lived to ſee and hear it. To be taken off alſo in the midſt of thoſe great Deſigns which he had projected, and die now, though not at the command, yet
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99302:146"/>at the pleaſure and deſire of all his Enemies, filled him with more Fury then could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And to all theſe we may add thoſe horrid tortures which the ſage and vertuous <hi>Greeks</hi> affirmed do ariſe in every Tyrant's breaſt, from the memory of their paſt Crimes, when every Vice makes an incurable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable wound, not to be healed or aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the ſofteſt Pleaſures; when the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals that remain after this life, though to a conſtant Felicity they appear but like the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a troubleſome Dream, yet in the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous approach of Death are dreſſed and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with real Terrours. We cannot but judge this Tyrant and all ſuch as imitate him have miſery enough in their Ends, to make their ignominious Honours and uncertain Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be unenvied by the moſt impotent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Wracked thus in Soul and Body, which were both unequal to ſuch cruel Pangs, and could not laſt long under the execution, the poiſonous humour having invaded every nerve and member, and made an inteſtine war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween life and death; his Mind alſo torn a pieces with various Luſts and Paſſions, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither with it ſelf nor with the Body, but in common Miſeries, and either's pains increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the other's tortures: he was perplexed with another care, how to ſecure his two youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99302:146"/>Children with their Mother <hi>Theagena;</hi> a Woman that was venerable no leſs for her Vertues then for her Beauty, had no other Crime but that ſhe was his Wife, and yet made her ſelf more eminent by this his Fortune. For <hi>he well knew that one Wickedneſs was to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by another;</hi> and that he which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the death of the Father, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Children to grow up to a revenge, nor permit the Wife with her tears to keep alive the hatred of her Husbands murderer, but either divert her Grief with her Diſhonour, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm it with her Blood. He therefore deſires her to ſecure her ſelf and the common pledges of their love in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> from whence he had married her, and to take with her all his Riches, the Jewels and ornaments of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Greatneſs, and the ſpoils of oppreſſed and injured Nations, to be their ſubſiſtence in an adverſe Fortune, and to leave the prey of his Kingdome as poor as he could to his violent Succeſſour. That the Tyrant might want no vexation, even the Piety of his Wife was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother affliction to him, who denied to obey ſuch ungrateful commands, and deſired that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>She might not be divorced from him till death had ſealed the bill, that her departure might not be as infamous as was the Parricide of another; for ſhe ſhould ſeem no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane in leaving her miſerable Husband, then he was in murdering his Grandfather. <pb n="256" facs="tcp:99302:147"/>She could not forget the laws of wedlock, though He had raſed out the dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for She had contracted as well with his adverſe as proſperous fortunes. Nor would ſhe be unwilling to perform her laſt office, of receiving the expiring groans of her dying Husband, and taking care for his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exequies, though ſhe lived no longer to mourn for him, and were buried in the ſame grave with him.</hi>
                  </q> This undeſerved Piety, and the tears of his Children, increaſed the diſtracting ſorrows of him that was forced from longer enjoying ſo rare an example of Love, and could not expreſs any gratitude for it, but bequeath Miſery to Her and her's. This drew an abundance of unfeigned tears to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay her laſt kiſſes. And when his Children bewailed their tortured Father, he mourns over their unkind Deſtinies, who being educated in the ſupremeſt fortune, were now to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the extremeſt Dangers. But when for a long time all ſought comforts from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and none could give, Neceſſity ſeparated them, and the Tyrant was left a miſerable ſpectacle to every eye, but to ſuch as had been witneſſes of his own Cruelty.</p>
               <p>After they were gone, and with them all the comforts of his Life, he ſought for ſome in his Death by revenge. For though all things were conſumed in him, yet his Cruelty ſtrived<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99302:147"/>to be immortal. Therefore calling an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people, his bloody Soul belched forth through his perjured mouth (where almoſt all the inſtruments of Speech were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Poiſon) ſome half-formed words of Cruelty and Revenge. Inveighing againſt the Impiety of <hi>Archagathus,</hi> he deſired the <hi>Syracuſans</hi>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>not to let ſuch a curſed Example, which might ruine both private Families and Commonwealths, to paſs unpuniſhed; and that they might doe this, he reſtores to them their Liberty, and declares them a free State.</hi>
                  </q> A liberality that Tyrants are never guilty of, but when they cannot keep the power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nor did he intend it as a Benefit, but to engage them in Wars; which with all the conſequents ſhould force them to thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows after his Death which he knew they would not have for it; and that a continued preſence of Miſeries might make thoſe ſeem lighter which were paſt, and the hatred of a living Enemy might alleviate the infamy of a deceaſed Oppreſſor. Beſides, the habits of Cruelty contracted by Tyrants do make them ſo unſatiable of blood, and ſo delighted in publick Calamities, that as by them their Lives and Greatneſs were maintained, ſo would they have their Deaths comforted. He that had made the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the Stage of his Cruelty, deſired that the world might fall<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99302:148"/>together with him. <hi>Herod,</hi> that had polluted all his Kingdome with Maſſacres, to temper the people's joy at his Death, would have had ſome hundreds of the moſt eminent <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſlain at his expiring, that ſo every Family might have ſomething to be wail, and ſhed tears at his deceaſe. So <hi>Agathocles</hi> (for all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants live and die with the like affections) would have intailed Calamities to the miſerable
<hi>Syracuſans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tyrant's Tortures ſtill increaſing, and Vengeance purſuing him with ſo ſlow a pace, as if it had intended to return his own arts of Cruelty upon himſelf, he lived for ſome time Cruelty upon himſelf, and a loathed burden to all that were about him: and having no Friend to provide for the decency of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, or by ſome care to alleviate his Pains, when the tumours of the poiſonous humour had hindred his Voice, ſo that neither his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints nor Threatnings could be underſtood,
<hi>Oxythemis</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> ſpy, and the
<hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſan</hi>'s falſe Friend, together with his tired Attendants, laid him before he was dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his funeral Pile, and burnt him alive. As ſoon as he was dead, the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> pulled down and broke all his Statues; ſeized upon his Goods and ſold them, and then did by proclamation declare themſelves a free People,<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99302:148"/>and return to their Democratical Government. Thus after he had enſlaved his own City twenty eight years, in the ſeventy ſecond year of his age he came to ſuch a miſerable end as his hateful Crimes and Impieties deſerved; and not onely the Revenge of Men, but the Juſtice of Heaven did appear in his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The lineaments and proportion of his Body are not recorded by Hiſtorians, onely by the ſins of his youth it appears that it was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving object of the Luſts of others, and that it was too fair a fabrick for ſo wicked a Soul. His actions give us the fulleſt character of the temper of his Mind. He was quick and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of every expedient for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, induſtrious and bold in the execution; fitted for Glory, if he had minded Vertue; powerful to perſwade, but without Faith in his Promiſes, or Truth in his Aſſeverations; adapted to reconcile the Affections of men to himſelf, but not careful to preſerve their Love or continue their Friendſhip any longer then he had an opportunity to injure thoſe that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him; inſatiably greedy of Greatneſs, but a deſpiſer of an honeſt F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e; of ſuch eaſie and ductile Paſſions, that he could tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and compoſe them according to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of his Deſigns, and put on whatſoever<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99302:149"/>ſhape his preſent Intereſt required. He was of an obſtinate ſilence to conceal his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but perſpicacious of the counſels of his Enemies. He was not nice of any Sin, nor fearful of any Ignominy. With all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to Tyranny he was acquainted; and wanted not, in an unquiet City, fortunate opportunities of attaining Power. But his Crimes were greater then his Power, and more prodigious then his Fortune: ſo that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be born for the deſtruction of men and ruine of Cities. For from the time that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear as conſiderable in the World, that Age and the Scene whereon he acted was horrid with various Miſeries, terrible, and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Battels, rent in pieces with diverſe Factions, and even in Peace was full of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. Deſarts were filled with baniſh'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Sea infected with blood, and the Rocks polluted with the putrifying carcaſſes of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Innocents: the Cities of <hi>Sicily, Africk</hi> and
<hi>Italy</hi> defiled with the frequent Murders of their own Citizens, deformed by many Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and Spoils, and ſome of them buried in their own Aſhes. Nor was his barbarous rage ſatisfied with the vexations and tortures of men in their Bodies and Fortunes; but being inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable with the Miſeries of Mankind, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deprive them of the comforts of Religion; by murdering the miſerable ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99302:149"/>at the Altars of their Gods, raſing down their Temples, and ſacrilegiouſly deſpoiling the Sacred treaſures of the teſtimonies of the Piety of former Ages, he diſcouraged the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the worſhip of their God. He did extirpate all ſenſe of Vertue, by imputing it for a capital Crime; and the glorious acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People's love by honeſt arts and generous actions was eſteemed by him as a mark for Ruine. Treachery and Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were the onely qualities he loved as Vertues in himſelf, and rewarded in others. He attempted the extinguiſhing of all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection: To bewail the unhappineſs of a tortured Friend was accounted as a deſign of Revenge and practice of Revolt from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt commander. Therefore the tears of pity were mingled with the blood of the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate; the Children were murdered that the Father might not periſh by a ſingle death. He expoſed the Son to the arrow of the Father, and offered the Brother to the Brother's ſword.</p>
               <p>As his life was ſpent in theſe hateful Crimes, ſo was it ended in horrid tortures, and he could not be ſaid to Die, but to be driven out of the world, and forced from among the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, after he had lived to ſee his curſed Iſſue part miſerably periſh'd, and part expoſed to a<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99302:150"/>certain deſtruction. Two of his Sons he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had betraied to the fury of an injured &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Army. His third Son was murdered when he had propoſed him to Empire, and his ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered carcaſs brought to increaſe the torments of his Soul. His younger Children, who had lived no longer then to be made ſenſible of the height from which they had fallen, were forced with their Mother to the dangers of Exile, and to periſh in an obſcure fortune. <hi>Archagathus</hi> his grandchild fell, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, by the ſame Inſtrument which he had ſollicited to his deſtruction. For <hi>Maenon</hi> proud with the ſucceſs of having deſtroied the Old Tyrant, reſolved to kill the Young one alſo: therefore applying himſelf to the uſual arts and waies of alluring the multitude, which are ſeldome good, he got ſuch a power in the Army, that he ſlew
<hi>Archagathus,</hi> aſſumed his Command, and would have impoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Prince upon the People. But the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> that had under the former Tyrant felt the extremeſt bondage, and ſince his death taſted the ſweetneſs of Liberty, were tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of it, and hoped to maintain it. They therefore ſent out their Praetor <hi>Nicetas</hi> with an Army to oppoſe <hi>Maenon.</hi> Who doubting his own Forces were too weak for thoſe of the People, followed the practices of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptor, and called the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> to his aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99302:150"/>and ſo engaged the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> in a ſeries of Wars, till <hi>Hiero</hi> did become their Prince, who in his private fortune wanted no requiſite of a King but a Kingdome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him they found the benefits of a lawful Government, and that Liberty is beſt ſecured under a Juſt Prince.</p>
